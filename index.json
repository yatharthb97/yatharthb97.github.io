[{"content":"Transcription Networks - Basic Concepts The cell continuously monitors its environment and calculates the amount of each protein that is needed. The rate of production is controlled by transcription networks.\nTo represent environmental states, cells use special proteins called transcription factors as symbols. Transcription factors are molecules that can rapidly switch between active and inactive molecular states, with rates determined by environmental factors. Transcription factors bind to DNA and regulate read-rate of genes. Transcription factors regulate their target genes to mobilize the appropriate protein response in each case. flowchart LR genes --transcribed--\u003e mRNA --translated--\u003e proteins; proteins--modify--\u003eenvironment; environment --what?--\u003e genes E. coli: has an internal representation of about 300 degrees of freedom. Hence, it has 300 transcription factors.\nTranscription Network Model Gene: a stretch of DNA whose sequence encodes the information needed for production of a protein. Transcription: Gene is copied into a disposable mRNA molecule by RNA polymerase (RNAp). Promoter: The number of mRNA produced per unit time is controlled by a regulatory region of DNA that precedes the gene which is called promoter. It regulates the chemical affinity of the DNA to mRNA (opposite is a Repressor). Transcription factors can act as both: activators and repressors. Transcription factor proteins are themselves regulated by other transcription factors. flowchart LR; Gene-- copied by RNAp into --\u003e mRNA .- transcription; mRNA -- translated to --\u003e Protein .- translation; Representation of Network Nodes \u0026amp; Edges x → Y : Product of genes X is a promoter for the transcription of gene Y. X ⟞ Y : Product of genes X is a repressor for the transcription of gene Y. Mechanism of Transcription Networks The input of transcription factor network are signals. Each signal is a small molecule, protein modification or molecular partner that directly affects the activity of one of the transcription factors.\nThe signal usually causes physical changes in the shape of the TF protein - active molecular state.\nMajority of the proteins are not transcription factors, rather they are building blocks or catalysts.\nSeparation of Timescales:\nProcess Timescale Input Signal changes Transcription Factor ~msec Binding of active Transcription Factor to DNA equilibration ~sec Transcription and Translation of the target genes ~minutes Accumulation of the Protein Product ~hours Hence, when considering network dynamics of protein levels, the transcription factor activity levels can be considered to be in steady state.\nTranscription networks are extremely modular in nature. (GFP from jellyfish) is widely used in experiments. Promoter of effect A + Gene of effect B → mechanism that causes a when B is true. Promoters and genes are generally interchangeable. This fact also means that these networks can evolve rapidly.\nThe arrows in the transcription network evolve on a much faster timescale than the coding regions of the genes (time scale of many generations).\nEach transcription factor acts primarily in one mode for its target genes, as either an activator or repressor. However, the input mode of regulation [of a gene] is often mixed.\nInput Functions The strength of the effect of a transcription factor on a target gene is escribed by an input function.\nX regulates Y : the number of molecules of protein Y produced per unit time is a function of the concentration of X in its active form $X^{*}$.\nRate of production $Y = f(X^*)$.\nA useful function that realistically describes many gene input functions is called the Hill function. $$ f(X^*) = \\beta\\frac{X^{*n}}{\\Kappa^{n} + X^{*n}} $$\nK : activation coefficient, which has units of concentration. It defines the concentration of active X needed to significantly activate expression.\n$X^* = K$ : half-maximal expression.\n$K$ is mainly determined by the chemical affinity between $X$ and its binding site on the promoter.\n$\\beta$ : maximal promoter activity. It is reached when $X^* \\gg K$.\nThe Hill Coefficient $n$ determines the steepness of the input function. For larger n, the function is more step-like.\nUsually, input functions are moderately steep: n=1-4.\nFor a repressor, the hill function is a decreasing function.\nHence, each arrow in the network can be thought to carry at least three numbers: $\\beta, K, n$. These numbers can be readily tuned during evolution.\n$K$ : Can be varied if the position of the binding site is changed. $\\beta$ : can be tuned by the mutations in the RNAp binding site. Laboratory evolution experiments show that when placed in a new environment, bacteria can accurately tune these numbers within several hundred generations to reach optimal expression levels. Thus, these numbers are under selection pressure and can heritably change over many generations if environments change.\nMany genes have a nonzero minimal expression level, called the gene\u0026rsquo;s basal expression level. It can be described by adding a $\\beta_0$ term.\nThe essence of the input functio n is a transition between low and high values, with a characteristic threshold $K$.\nWe can hence approximate the input function with a logic approximation. It can be expressed as : $f(X^{ * }) = \\beta\\theta(X^{ * }\u0026gt; K)$. It is equivalent to a Hill function with $n \\rightarrow \\infty$.\nFor a repressor: $f(X^{ * }) = \\beta \\theta(X^{ * } \u0026lt; K)$ .\nMulti-dimensional input functions:\n$f(X^{ * }, Y^{ * }) = \\beta\\theta(X^{ * } \u0026gt; K_x)\\theta(Y^{ * }\u0026gt; K_y)$ ~ X AND Y $f(X^{ * }, Y^{ * } ) = \\beta\\theta(X^{ * } \u0026gt; K_x + Y^* \u0026gt; K_y)$ ~ X OR Y SUM input function: $f(X^{ * }, Y^{ * }) = \\beta_xX^{ * }+ \\beta_yY^{ * }$. More complex functions with many inputs\u0026hellip; Dynamics \u0026amp; Response Time $$ X + S_x \\rightarrow X^{} \\ X^ \\rightarrow P_y + mRNA \\rightarrow Protein_Y $$\n$S_x$ is the activation signal for $X$. $P_y$ is a promoter of gene $Y$.\nThe concentration of a protein in a cell is regulated by two processes: degradation ($\\alpha_{deg}$) and dillution ($\\alpha_dil{}$). The total removaal rate is hence: $\\alpha = \\alpha_{dil} + \\alpha_{deg}$. This gives us the the following dynamic equation of the concentration of a protein Y: $dY/dt = \\beta + \\alpha Y$. Solving this equation yields the steady state concentration of the protein as: $Y_{st} = \\beta / \\alpha$.\nThis is however a simplified model. The regulation of protein in reality happens at every step of the production. While the protein is contructed in cohesion with the mRNA, various micro-steps have their own regulatory mechanisms.\nResponse Time The response time is a measure of speed of a dynamical process. It is the time needed to reach halfway $T_{1/2}$ between the inital and the final levels in a dynamical process. For an example, if we assume that the protein production of Y has come to a halt. Hence, $\\beta = 0$. The dynamical equation then simplifies to: $$ Y(t) = Y_{st}e^{- \\alpha t} $$ Solving the above equation yields: $$ Y(t_{response}) = Y_{st} / 2 \\newline T_{1/2} = log(2) / \\alpha $$ This leads us to the following realisations:\nRemoval rate $\\alpha$ determines the response time. Fast removal allowes for rapid changes in the concentration of the protein. The production rate $\\beta$ determines the steady state concentration, but not the respone time. Proteins with big $\\alpha$ also need large $\\beta$ to sustain their steady state rates. This might seeem completely futile, but this tradeoff can be used for rapidy changing concentration of certain proteins.

If the environmental changes outpace the changes in the genetic material that causes viable responses; pure genetic adaptation is no longer a vaible option. Physarum polycephalum : Smart behaviour in slime mold. It can solve mazes by exploring its environment by extending a network of cytoplasmic matter and leaving chemical trails — essentially doing a non-backtracking random walk. Neurons as computational units Synapses: Electrical Chemical Axons have Myelin Sheaths have interruptions called nodes of Ranvier. The signal then jumps faster between the nodes. The distance between two such nodes has to be optimized for reliable transfer. Two evolutionary scenarios for the evolution of neutrons: Single-origin hypothesis: in some organisms there was a loss of nervous systems — Homologous systems. Multiple origin hypothesis: neural abilities evolved in different organisms at different times — Convergent Systems. Electrical code: Creation of an electrical code in neurons relies in 3 distinct modules of proteins: Ion homeostasis: creates the potential energy for the action potential. Transduction: transduces sensory and intercellular into electrical code. Propogation: propagates the electrical signals along neurons. Key tasks of neuronal ion homeostasis: maintianing a negative voltage across the membrane to power action potentials — P-type ATPases maintaining low levels of cytoplasmic $Ca^{2+}$, since it regulates intra-cellular communications. Transduction. the first step in neural signalling: Of the many protein families involved in transduction, only two are metazoan (multi-cellular) novelties. Propagation: local electrical signals will attenuate over space. To propogate over large distance, neurons use ion channels respond to voltage itself, called voltage-gated ion channels. Action potentials are used across different biological systems to mediate processes: Bacterial biofilms also use regenerative potential changes to coordinate colony growth, etc\u0026hellip; Evolution of voltage-gated sodium channels: The key change allowed this development was the evolution of voltage-gated sodium channles (Nav) from preexisting voltage-gated calcium channels (Cav). $Na^+$ does not broadly triggert cellular signalling pathways as $Ca^{2+}$ does. $K^+$ ion channels are then used for traspondence of signals across the neutron. Chemical synapses and electrical synapses: Electrical system is faster but the chemical one is more precise and cn be moduled in a variety of ways. Each step of the chemical signalling can be moduled in Chemical signalling. Evolution of synapse: synapses likely originated from cell junctions in early metazoans.

Learning by watching or passive learning is called social learning. It is not the same as community learning. The learner does not experience the task itself, just observes and perceives it.

Specifically it is everything that grows below the germinating seed. Stuff above it is called endocotyl.\nSteeper leaf angle is called hyponasty and is a phenotype that is amplified by rising temperature. Thermomorphogenesis - benefits:\nmore distance of leaves from soil: less exposure to heat reflection from soil. more open rosette: better cooling due to better air circulation. Cooler leaves: mean higher photosyntheti efficiency. Blue and red light photoreceptors that plants use to grow.\nRed light activates Phytochrome B (PHYB).

Zygote? Somatic cells: make the body. Mutations in the Somatic cells are not passed on to the next generation. Pluripotency/totipotency:\n​\tThe Spemann-Mangold Experiment:\nThe experiments at Thomas Hunt Morgan\u0026rsquo;s lab used Deosophila to show the inheritance of traits that were particularly present on the genetic material of one of the parent. They could definatively claim that the genetic encoding was present on the chromosomes using their experiments.\nSomatic Cell Nuclear Transfer:\nGenes control embryonic development: This was illustrated using the \u0026ldquo;Hox Genes\u0026rdquo;, where they modified a single gene, with whose modification, they were able to indice the development of many legs in Drosophila.\nZebra Fish is used as a model organism because you can see the whole embryonic development process clearly under the microscope.\nMorphogens A morphogen is a molecule that controls the formation of patterns during embryonic development through their non-unifrom distribution.\nMorphogenes were identified that control the patterns during embryonic development stages.\nInduction Two kinds of Induction Instructive: Tissue is told what to become. Permissive: Tissue knows what to become already, it wait for its trigger.

For Tropicalis, it can be controlled quite well. The origin of these frogs is in Africa. In the wild, they are very agressive and at many places they have become an invasive species. Xenbase Xenopus are websites that are databases for Xenopus. How this started? : Luigi Galvani and the frog mustle experiment(s). Electric fields drive neural crest migration ex vivo. The Xenopus Pregnancy Test Inject frogs with urine sample while them swim in a sterile buffer. The sampl was injected near the overies of the femaile Xenopus.\nOnly effective for detection if the pregnancy was about 3-5 weeks.\nRelease of frog eggs would indicate a pregnancy.\nLancelot Hogben established the first Xenopus colony at the London School of Economics in 1927.\nExploited the fact that Xenopus females laid eggs in response to human chrionic gondatropin.\nDown to Embroyos The nucleus from the same species can be transplanted into an egg and it can develop to a tadpole and beyond.\n\u0026lsquo;Something\u0026rsquo; happens later when the cells get differentiated that makes the nucleus unable to be reprogrammed.\nLater in 2012, John B. Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka got the Nobel Prize for their work in understanding \u0026rsquo;the something\u0026rsquo; - which today is called nuclear reprogramming.\nRobert Briggs and Thomas J King did the very first nuclar transplantation in Xenopus.\nSpemann-Mongold organizer 1924: they discovered the Spemann-Mongold organizer which is a portion of the embroyo that induces other cells to organize specifically. The motor of morphogenesis Fate maps: put fluorophores in a particular locations and track where they end up during morphogenesis.

Turnover rate approx. 3-5 days (the time taken by the cell to be born and to die). Small intestine: is the largest mucosal surface of the body and also the fastest-renewing epithelium in mammals (3-5 days). The cells in the samll intestines form in the crypt and migrate over the vilius to the extrusion part, where they form mucas and eventually die. The gut epithelium is a dynamic tissue barrier. You have different stresses: Chemicals - toxins Mechanical - pressure, stretch Biological - pathogens How is the balance achieved between division, migration, and extrusion ? The cell-division only takes place in the crypt, it cannot take place in the extrusion. Hence, small intestine cancers are extremey rare (there are many other reassons like a short lifecycle). By running biophysical model we can simulate the density and velocity profiles. By comparing with the experimental data, it was found that active migration was a necessary component in the dynamics of these migrating cells. Gut epithelium is under tension because the cell migration is pulling on the cell-cell junctions. Laser ablations are used to map junctional tensions.

Another man who already bought 3 pairs of red socks and 3 pairs of white socks came back to return his 3 pairs of red socks and 3 pairs of white socks. They are both blind. As they were walking they bumped into each other. All the socks scattered around the floor, but each pair remained held together by a rubber band. Nobody helped them pick it up except each other, but in 3 minutes they both put them back altogether. Each man ended up with the same colors of socks he started with: six red and six white. How is that possible if they are blind?\nHow do cells divide?\nKangaroo-Rat from Australia as our model organiosm, since it has only 12 to 13 chromosomes.\nInsects (like the Drosophilia) divide for 13 generations in a single \u0026ldquo;Pangea cell\u0026rdquo;. Hence, the division is extremenly synchronised.\nQuestions The constraint of space. Can\u0026rsquo;t we have a bigger nucleus? So that more space allows for less crowding bias.\nHow much force does the spindles apply when they are pulling apart the chromatins?\nHow do they [the spindles] know when its the right time to pull ?\nHow do Chromosomes find their way?\nSeveral models have been proposed. Mathematically, it was found that a random microtuble search of the space would not be enough.\nThe number of mechanisms that promote effcient chromosome capture are about 6-7 in number and still increasding.\nAnswers The correct position to grab the chromosome is done using mechanosensing.

They also form cilia.\nMost human cells have cellia, hence, problems with cillia results in a myriad of seemingly unconnected pathologies. Like Retinal degeneration, Kidney Cysts, Cognitive defects.\nCillia Assembly: The centrosomes goes to the membrane and starts assembling a microtuble structure called the Cillium.\nCentrioles are not necessary for cell division. Cell divisions can happen without it. Many organism families have dropped it altogether.\nA centrosome has two centrioles.\nChromosomes can also nucleate microtubles, hence, centrosoles are redundant for cell division.\nHuman/Mice Cells need Centrioles for cell division.\nKinesisns can also bind together to focus microtuble spindles.\nMore than one centrosome can cause a variety of cancers because they can interfere during cell division and cause aneuploidy.\nCells adapt to multiple centrosomes by clustering them, especially cancer cells.\nSenior IGC Fellow: Pedro\nBacteria have something similar to Actin and Tubilin.\nCancer Centrosomes \u0026amp; Cancer Mitosis\nAsymetric cell division\nAneuploidy\nIncreased/Decreased signalling plateform\nIncreased Microtuble directed polarization\nAltered Rho GTPhase activity andd Altered Focal adhesion turnover\nDay 3 Membrane Protein Proteostasis Colin Adrian 30% of proteins encoded are pushed into the Endoplasmic Reticulum, and are membrane or secretary proteins.\nWe have organelles to sepertate many different chemical processes : to compartmentalize them.\nFluid Mosaic Model:1972 to present\nTransmembrane domains are alpha helices that can be used to classify memebrane proteins\nPolytopic membrane: TODO\nCharged residues are used to emable polymerization or dimerisation.\n~50% of membrane is composed of transmembrane proteins.\nMembrane proteins are often difficult to fold.

Also study proteins using variety of techniques like ML and computational design. Moplecular Interactions in Biomolecules Non-covalent interactions modelled via Lennard-Jones, consists of van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds. Two neutral atoms in close proximity get polarised ! Van der waals radius is r1 + r2 and is the point where the repulsive interactions become dominent. Hydrogen bonds can be thought of as a dipole-dipole interaction but on a molecular scale. Iconic interactions are the strongest, however, water ions severly reduce electrostatic interaction. In vacuum its ~50 kJ/mol, whereas in water its ~6 kJ/mol.

Polar amino acids can form hydrogen bonds with itself and other amino acids. They are also hydrophobic. Negatively and positively charged amino acids. Their sidechains are charged at pH=7.

It forms by making H-bonds between Hydrogen and oxygen.\n$\\beta$-sheets form hydrogen bonds with its whole backbone.\nUsually the alpha and beta sheets are sometimes misaligned and imperfect.\nAlpha-helix\nIn the alpha-helix, the carbonyl oxygen of residue \u0026ldquo;i\u0026rdquo; forms a hydrogen bond with the amide of the residue \u0026ldquo;i+4\u0026rdquo;. There are only right handed alpha-helixes, except for a handful of exceptions. Beta-sheets\nCan be wither parallel and antiparallel. They have roughly the same binding energy. In a beta-sheet, carbonyl oxygen and amides form hydrogen bonds between the strands, i.e between amino acids far away from each other in primary sequence. Proteins can be composed of one of the two secondary structures or be mixed.\nBeyond Secondary Structures The tertiary structure, which is the three-dimensional organisation of the secondary structure elements. It is also referred to as the protein fold. Quaternary structures refers to the association of different polypeptide chains (subunits) into a multinumeric complex. Protein domains are fundamental units of tertiary structue. it forms an independnt structural domin. They are often units of function. Domains have the same fold yet different amino acid sequences. Protein domains are very stable to mutations. ANd they have been selected via evolution for the very specific reason. The stability of the folded structure results primarily from the hydrophobic regions folding in together. Two proteins with different sequences can have the same sequence. Conformations and Folding Protein conformational changes does not require breaking bonds. The peptide bond has partial double bond character and therefore are sterically hindered. Protein folding induces conformational changes in the backbone. The backbone torsion angles $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ determine that conformation of the protein chain. The Ramachandran diagram define the restrictions on backbone conformation. $\\psi$ : TODO $\\phi$ : TODO L: Left handed helix You see a lot of Glycines in loops as they are flexible because of the absence of any side chains. Prolines are in Cis conformation so they ususally \u0026ldquo;kink\u0026rdquo; the alpha-helix. Not generally found anywhere else. Secondary structural elements are conected to form simple motifs. Given motifs, you can create many folds. The interactions between the atoms in a protein control the folding of the protein into a well defined structure (native structure): Thermodynamic hyposthesis of protein folding. It was demonstrated by the famous Anfinsen Experiment which opened the folded structure of a protein and allowed it to relax in a controlled manner to recover the folded structure, This information is encoded in their amino acid sequence. Evolution and Protein Structure by Casper Goverde Reading Suggestion: The Molecules of Life (Chapter 5)\nProtein structures are conserved during evolution while amino acids vary.\nMotifs that are crutial for protein folding are conserved during evolution.\nYou can use protein globins to classify species at the molecular level.\nDue to different selection pressures amd line seperation, protein sequences diverge between species.\nHow to quantify differences in sequences? Use a substitution matrix (BLOSUM). We use a matrix of probailities. Each entry in the matrix is called a substitution score ($S_{ij}$). The higher the score (positive), the more likely is the substition.\nThe BLOSUM substitution score is the logarithm of the likelihood that one aa in a protein is replaced by another during evolution.\n$S_{ij}$ is related to the frequency of substititon over random chance.\nBLAST (Basic Local Alignmnet Search Tool) : Identify novel proteins, find functional relationships and sequence motifs and patterns.\nTOP-7 is the first synthetic motif.\nThe most used measure is the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD).\nDomains are \u0026ldquo;self contained units\u0026rdquo; that can be placed in different proteins.\nPyMol Excercises Superimposition is done by fitting the polypeptide backbone of your target protein on the reference protein. Best fit will have smallest Rms (root mean square) value.\nWhat is PSIPRED?\nProtein crystals have a high solvent content, which you can also observe as large spaces between the proteins in the Electron density maps.\nDay 2\nX-ray Crystallography The further out spots the higher the resolution of the protein structure.\nThe dark ring ~3Å is caused by water molecules un the crystal.\nflowchart LR crystals --\"x-rays\"--\u003e diffraction-pattern --\u003e electron-density-maps--\u003eatomic-structure atomic-structure --refinement--\u003ediffraction-pattern Methods to check crystallization conditions for proteins: Hanging Drop- and Sitting Drop- Vapour Diffusion.\nTypical concentration for X-ray diffraction: TODO\nHigh B-factor: low confidence in position of atom, which also corresponds to low electron densities.\nIn 2020 the number of structures in PDB reached 171,916.\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Resonance Frequency in NMR: $$ R_f = \\frac{2 \\mu_BB_o}{h} $$\nResonance frequency depends on nature of the nucleus and its chemical environment.\nResonance frequency is directly proportional to the strength of the external applied magnetic field.\nWe commonly use $H^1$ and $C^{13}$ for labelling as they are NMR active.\nNuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE): Provides information on spatial proximity of protons in protein. Protons that are close by influence each others chemical shifts.\nCrystallography si also applicable to very big proteins and complexes.\nNMR: Dynamic ensemble of several energy-minimized structures, whereas, X-ray crystallography gives a static picture of protein.\nNMR has a size limit: \u0026gt;25kDa is very difficult.\nCryo-EM Cryo-EM prevents electron degradation of proteins.\nAbbe\u0026rsquo;s Relationship: $d_R = 1.22 \\lambda /NA$.

This is the first stop to check an unknown protein. It contains references to other databases as well. There are multiple .pdb files for a single protein corresponsiong to all the different experiments done with the protein. They might have different resolutions, and precision. PhosphoSite Plus : provides comprehensive information and tools for the study of protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) including phosphorylation, acetylation, and more.

AlphaFold flowchart LR Sequence --\u003e Structure --\u003e Function Each step involves shrinking of the total phase space of that particular function.\nCritical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) - competition held for prediction of Protein Structure. The FOM is GDT (Global Distance Test). AlphaFold 1 was the first to combine Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) and Deep Neural Networks. MSA finds similar sequence across different species, aligns, and then find \u0026ldquo;suitable mutations\u0026rdquo; or the set of all possible mutations (coevolution). If something mutates to a more positive base, the other base can mutate to something more negative, but not positive. We calculate distance matrix -\u0026gt; Correlation matrix. A neural network can approximate any function, given that your neural network has arbitrary width and we have an infinite dataset. AlphaFold also uses a Convolutional neural networks to recognise patterns. Output is the distance matrix, and the distance matrix of the two dihedral angles $\\phi$ and $\\psi$. The Input for AlphaFold-2 is the MSA.

It is a lot faster with improved MSA step. It also allows for complex predictions.\nAlphaFold 2 practice notebook\nDay 3\nBinding Spontaneous process at constant temperature and pressure always involves decrease in the Gibbs Free energy of the system ($dG \u0026lt; 0$).\nIt accounts for both enthalpic and entropic contributions of the system. $$ dG = dH - TdS $$\nEquilibrium Constants:\n$$ \\Delta G^0 = -RTlnK_{eq} \\rightarrow K_{eq} = e^{- \\frac {\\Delta G^0}{RT}} $$\nHomo Sapiens: ~15, 000 proteins expresses. 135,000 pp-interactions. Specificity is the ratio of binding affinities. They are theoreticlly not related. Innature, Higher affinity implies lower specificity. Binding sites usually have a hydrophobic core and then on the rim, you have bases that have specificity. Whwn fraction $f$ is half in a reaction, out dissociation constant $K_D$ equals the ligand concentration $L$. Univeral binding isotherm is expressed in terms of $K_D$. Drug Binding by Proteins Find a Lead compound. That bind to the receptor. They are usually not very specific and affinative. Iterate the lead compound to imrove specificity and affinity. Competative inhibitors: $IC_{50}$ is the concentration of the inhibitor that reduces the binding of the protein by half maximal value. $IC_{50}s$ are used rather than a single value because the activity of the drug may vary between the population just because of random mutations. Energetics of the Binding: There is entropic loss but enthalpic gain. $\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S$ The affinity for a protein for a ligand is characterized by the dissociation constant, $K_D$. The strength of binding interactions is often correlated with hydrophobicity.

The top-down design method\nA better approach is the de novo protein design: It takes a Bottom-up functional protein design. It is much more computationally expensive and suffers from a very low success rate.\nAdded an MC Step to the protein iteration step for scoring random mutations.\n\u0026ldquo;Oracle models\u0026rdquo;\nExercise Notes “MaSIF receives a protein surface as an input and outputs a predicted score for the surface on the likelihood of being involved in a PPI.”\n— Assignment sheet\nMaSIF can be used for iteratively for negative designing i.e. to remove features from the protein structure.\nDay 4\nDNA structure and replication Marco Fumasoni The famous Photo 51 which was an X-ray crystallographic image of the DNA double helix strand. DNA replication proceeds only in one direction. It is because of the presence of phosphtes on the one side only, which is required for catalysis. The replication movement creates a \u0026ldquo;replication fork\u0026rdquo;, which leads to a leading strand (continuous synthesis) and lagging strand (discontinuous sequence). The fragments on the lagging strand are vcalled Okazaki fragments. Replisome; Average human chromosome: 150 Mbp Average Eukaryotic replisome speed: ~50 nt/s It will take 400 hours for the replication to occur. Hence there are 100s of origins for replication on a chromosome. How to identify DNA replication origins? (which are parts ) : Chop DNA, make some kind of loops with URA3. Only segments with Origins replicate and survive to grow into colonies. Deep Sequencing: sequencing of DNA at different time points gives rise to a frequency distribution, where the modes give you the Origin points. This method can also give you the speed of the fork , etc. With Cloning we can find all potential Origin sites, however, with Deep Sequencing, you find the Origins that are being actually used by the cell. End replication problem: Each time a cell divides, the chromosomes should be shortened. Finally the chromosomes should and be damaged. The telomere: Its a end point sequence that protects linear DNA from degradation by replacing the shortened DNA bases. Telomerase: the enzyme that does the replacement. Some cancers can express Telomerase to bypass the cell division limit. Telomers are repeated sequences. The T-loop hypothesis states that the end of the DNA strand loops back to itself to make a loop, so as to not signal as a broken DNA strand. The end-looping region is the Trlomer region. Different organisms also use different mechanisms to deal with end poins of its genetic material. Day 5\nCentromeres: from epigenetic to genetic Daniele Fachinetti Cell division has been studied for a long time because of its importance in lifes\u0026rsquo; processes.\nCentrosomes and centromere are the two key factors for cell division.\nThe centromere is a protein/DNA structure which links chromosomes to spindle microtubules.\nCentromeric architechtures are diverse:\nRegional centromeres Point centromeres Holocentromers Kineticore: Protein complex TODO\nIf there are problems with Kineticores, you get aneuploid. ~90% of solid human tumors and ~75% of hematopoietic cancers are aneuploid.\nKey steps for a centromere:\nCentromere Position (decision on the location of the centromere, which is permanent)\nCentromere function\nCentromere integrity\nThe 171-bp alpha satellite is the fundamental unit of the centromere DNA.\n~3% of the total human genome is chromomeric DNA. CENP-B is the only centromeric DNA-seq specific binding protein.\nThe centromeres exist in two domains: CENP-A and CENP-B.\nBigger centromere regions can lead to tangling of microtubles and chromatin during division.\nHistones:\nCENP-A and CENP-B arer particular histones that are specific to centromeres.\nWhere do Chromosomes go in interphase? Marco Fumasoni Interphase: Period between the cell divisions. During this phase, the genetic material (DNA) is replicated by the cell.\nIn mammals, you can find chromosomes that like to localize in a certain region of the nucleus.\nHow to build a mitotic chromosome? Raquel Oliveria mitosis means \u0026ldquo;threads\u0026rdquo;. The threads are the chromosomes.\nWhy cells need to build a mitotic chromosome?\nspatial compaction mechanical properties resolution of sister-chromatids switch off transcription Interphase to mitosis compaction: 2X compaction.\nAssembly of mitotic chromosomes is not fully known. There are several models:\nHierarchical folding Scaffold/radial-loop Chromatin network Thin Layer stack The localization of chromatin position explains how features far away in the genetic sequence regulate each other.\nPositive supercoils are formed when the Replication Fork travels through the chromatin strands. To release these tension:\nRotation of the replication fork itself. Nick the strand to release the tension and then re-attach. Topoisomerase II is required for decatenation and sister chromatin resolution Transcription is turned off during Mitosis. Dogmas:\nChromatin accessibility is limited.

How did the fly become such a dominant model organism in research? Science is produced locally, but it transmits globally. Universality: an idea of the epistemic validity of Science Locality:c science is influences by its local conditions of production Globally: the circulation of scientific knowledge, materials, and practices from one location to other. Thomas Hunt Morgan, American was responsible for coming up with Drosophilia model systems. Morgan get the Nobel Prize for \u0026ldquo;The Mechanisms of Mendelian Heridity\u0026rdquo;. He inbred flies in the lab in a bio-reactor to amplify rare mutations. The first mutant he discovered was controlling the eye color of the fly. He also found that mutations co-occur. So you can put mutations into discrete groups based on co-occurance. Chromosomes can cross over which results in recombination of genes. Recombination rates can be used as a measure of proximity. From this methotend to kill you, its d they were able to create a linear photo-map of the genes. This gets the PI a nobel prize. This also cements the Chromosome-gene theory for genetics. Gene is the unit of Structure, Function, Recombination, and Mutation. Morgan runs a tight ship of the Boss and the Bois. Chromosomes are proteins + DNA. Its Nucleoproteins. H.J. muller invents the Balanced Lethal Assay. He was able to show that their is a linear relationship between X-ray dosage and the amount of mutations. He got the nobel prize for this. Mammalian Genetics \u0026ldquo;Got a weird mouse? Kill it and ship it to Harvard!\u0026rdquo;\nThe process and hence the research is much slower.\nSeawell Wright works extensively on Gunnie pigs.\nBecause mutations in development tend to kill you, they are difficult to detect.\nMammal and maize geneticists were interested in variable phenotypes.\nThe variability of phenotypes and their mixtures can be explained by bringing time into picture. It is the temporal dependece of certain genes.\nConclusions The locus of univerality in Biology is the genetic code. Nothing else is universal in any way. Organisms evolve over time in complex ways to produce very distinct organismic systems. Genes in Action: The history of Development and genetics by Michael Dietrich Thomas Hunt Morgan was trained as an embryologist (a developmental biologist) but didnt adress problems from this field, ever!\nWilhelm Roux develops developmental mechanics and really likes experiments. \u0026ldquo;There are particles that determine the type of cell that develops.\u0026rdquo;\nWhere (and what) is the determinant of Development?\nJacques Loeb advocates the Reductionist Approach.

Hence, it was induced that the organiser is actually a chemical signal released by the dorsal fold area.\nDevelopment is seen as a phenomena that operates around t a network of chemical inducers that are responsible for producing different kinds of tissues. \u0026ldquo;A cascade of inducers.\u0026rdquo;\nNon-competent cells are not ready to receive a signal. Hence, time becomes important. It is also noteworthy that early developmental biologists thought that genes were not responsible for these \u0026ldquo;particles\u0026rdquo; (inducers), are purely chemical in nature. The question of the first inducer is still open.\nEmbronic development starts with making a normal table of development for a particular system.\nHomeotic Mutant: has a full body part where it was not supposed to be.\nWaddington´s Branching track Model for Aristapedia (which is a fly).\nWaddington is able to map variable pheontypes using the branch track model.\nWaddington´s cannalization theory with different developmental channels.

In mammals, Toll induces signals required for the activation of both an innate and an adaptive immune response.

While C++ has a mechanism through STL chrono, such a functionality is absent in python (as per my information).\nLibrary: GitHub Gist.\nWhat is a time-literal? Just to be clear, time literal here means anything of this form : 5ns, 4min, 15.5ms. It is a numeric value (float) followed by alphabetic constants that indicate special treatment of the alpha-numeric string constant. It is similar to the use of b while declaring bytes or using x while defining a hexadecimal integer:\nbinary = 0b10000 hexadecimal = 0x12f Since python does not natively support time-literals, it can be implemented by using python strings. Here is my attempt to do the same, and while we are at it, implement some additional features as well.\nHere is a rundown of the library: A value_pair is an entity of the following form: [float, TmLiteral]. The container should be a list. The first is the absolute numeric value and the second quantity is the units, which is represented by the TmLiteral object. value_pair is fundamental to this library, since strings are parsed into value pairs. All inter-conversions also apply to value pairs. For performing such operations, the literal must first be converted into a value_pair by using the TmParser object. To verify if the given entity is a valid value-pair:\nfrom tmliteral import * IsValuePair([4.2, FindTmL(\u0026#34;seconds\u0026#34;)]) #-\u0026gt; returns True IsValuePair([4.2, \u0026#34;seconds\u0026#34;]) #-\u0026gt; returns False Print all available pre-defined literals:\nimport tmliteral.time_table for tml in tmliteral.time_table: print(tml.abbr, \u0026#39; : \u0026#39;, tml) Output:\nxxx : invalid time value s : second Ys : yottasecond Zs : zettasecond Es : exasecond Ps : petasecond Ts : terasecond Gs : gigasecond Ms : megasecond ks : kilosecond hs : hectosecond das : decasecond ds : decisecond cs : centisecond ms : millisecond us : microsecond ns : nanosecond ps : picosecond fs : femtosecond as : attosecond zs : zeptosecond ys : yoctosecond min : minute h : hour d : day week : week year : calender year leapyear : calender leap year gregyear : gregorian calendar year julianyear : julian astronomical year Create a user defined literal or find a pre-defined literal:\n# Simulation unit which is equivalent to microseconds. sim_time = TmL(\u0026#34;sim\u0026#34;, -6, simulation unit) # TmL(abbr, exp, name, mul_factor=1.0) # Get a pre-defined time unit ms = FindTmL(\u0026#34;ms\u0026#34;) also_ms = FindTmL(\u0026#34;millisecond\u0026#34;) Parsing time literals from strings can be done by creating a parser object:\nparser = TmParser() parser.add_literal(sim_time) tm1 = parser.parse(\u0026#34;4.2fs\u0026#34;) # Out→ [4.2, \u0026lt; TmLiteral : femtosecond \u0026gt;] tm2 = parser[\u0026#34;4.2fs\u0026#34;] # Same tm_sim = parser[\u0026#34;5 sim\u0026#34;] # Out→ [5.0, \u0026lt; TmLiteral : simulation time \u0026gt;] Conversions between units (casting) can be handled by creating a cast object:\nns_cast = TmCast.Find(\u0026#34;ns\u0026#34;) # Make a nano-second cast time = parser[\u0026#34;5 ms\u0026#34;] ns_time = ns_cast.cast(time) # Returns 5000 ns_time2 = ns_cast[tm2] # Equivalent to `cast` member function. Using the TmAutoScale object, appropriate units can be selected automatically. The option tmparser in the initializer can be used to pass a custom TmParser object. The auto-scale object inherits the literal order of the parser object in the \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; mode. If this option is not specified, the auto-scaler constructs a new generic TmParser object.\nThis module is extremely useful with timing of processes and converts arbitrary time values in seconds (or nanoseconds) to more \u0026ldquo;human readable\u0026rdquo; units. The object can be constructed in a variety of mode:\n\u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; : Does not modify the preference of literals which is inherited from a parser object. prefer_clock_units\u0026quot; : Prefers clock units over SI. clock units are [\u0026ldquo;second\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;minute\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;hour\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;day\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;week\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;calender year\u0026rdquo;] \u0026ldquo;prefer_SI_units\u0026rdquo; : Prefers SI units over clock units. \u0026ldquo;clock\u0026rdquo; : Only uses clock units \u0026ldquo;SI\u0026rdquo; : Only uses SI units \u0026ldquo;extended_process_timing\u0026rdquo; : Uses [\u0026ldquo;nanoseconds\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;microseconds\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;milliseconds\u0026rdquo;] + clock units. This is useful for timing of processes which requires \u0026ldquo;human-comprehensible units\u0026rdquo; on a power scale. tauto = TmAutoScale(mode=\u0026#34;prefer_clock_units\u0026#34;) tauto.scale(parser[\u0026#34;4e5 picoseconds\u0026#34;], set_scale=100) #-\u0026gt;[399.99999999999994, \u0026lt; TmLiteral : nanosecond \u0026gt;] tauto2 = TmAutoScale(mode=\u0026#34;prefer_clock_units\u0026#34;) tauto2[\u0026#34;5e7 seconds\u0026#34;] #-\u0026gt; [1.5854895991882294, \u0026lt; TmLiteral : calender year \u0026gt;] tauto2[\u0026#34;5e4 seconds\u0026#34;] #-\u0026gt;[0.5787037037037037, \u0026lt; TmLiteral : day \u0026gt;] To print a value_pair properly the function TmFormat can be used:\ntime1 = parser[\u0026#34;5 ms\u0026#34;] time2 = parser[\u0026#34;1 ns\u0026#34;] print(TmFormat(time1, format=\u0026#34;full\u0026#34;)) #-\u0026gt; 5.0 milliseconds print(TmFormat(time1, format=\u0026#34;abbr\u0026#34;)) #-\u0026gt; 5.0 ms print(TmFormat(time2, format=\u0026#34;full\u0026#34;)) #-\u0026gt; 1.0 nanosecond print(TmFormat(time2, format=\u0026#34;abbr\u0026#34;)) #-\u0026gt; 1.0 ns Now my favorite feature: the Expression Parser can perform arithmetic operations on time values that have any arbitrary units. Operations that are currently supported : {+, - , *, /, %}.\nexp = TmExpParser() print(exp.parse(\u0026#34;10ms + 5ns + 10ms\u0026#34;)) #-\u0026gt; [0.020000005, \u0026lt; TmLiteral : second \u0026gt;] I did not have a use-case in mind for this feature.
