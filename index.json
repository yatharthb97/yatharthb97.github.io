[{"content":"Transcription Networks - Basic Concepts The cell continuously monitors its environment and calculates the amount of each protein that is needed. The rate of production is controlled by transcription networks.\nTo represent environmental states, cells use special proteins called transcription factors as symbols. Transcription factors are molecules that can rapidly switch between active and inactive molecular states, with rates determined by environmental factors. Transcription factors bind to DNA and regulate read-rate of genes. Transcription factors regulate their target genes to mobilize the appropriate protein response in each case. flowchart LR genes --transcribed--\u003e mRNA --translated--\u003e proteins; proteins--modify--\u003eenvironment; environment --what?--\u003e genes E. coli: has an internal representation of about 300 degrees of freedom. Hence, it has 300 transcription factors.\nTranscription Network Model Gene: a stretch of DNA whose sequence encodes the information needed for production of a protein. Transcription: Gene is copied into a disposable mRNA molecule by RNA polymerase (RNAp). Promoter: The number of mRNA produced per unit time is controlled by a regulatory region of DNA that precedes the gene which is called promoter. It regulates the chemical affinity of the DNA to mRNA (opposite is a Repressor). Transcription factors can act as both: activators and repressors. Transcription factor proteins are themselves regulated by other transcription factors. flowchart LR; Gene-- copied by RNAp into --\u003e mRNA .- transcription; mRNA -- translated to --\u003e Protein .- translation; Representation of Network Nodes \u0026amp; Edges x → Y : Product of genes X is a promoter for the transcription of gene Y. X ⟞ Y : Product of genes X is a repressor for the transcription of gene Y. Mechanism of Transcription Networks The input of transcription factor network are signals. Each signal is a small molecule, protein modification or molecular partner that directly affects the activity of one of the transcription factors.\nThe signal usually causes physical changes in the shape of the TF protein - active molecular state.\nMajority of the proteins are not transcription factors, rather they are building blocks or catalysts.\nSeparation of Timescales:\nProcess Timescale Input Signal changes Transcription Factor ~msec Binding of active Transcription Factor to DNA equilibration ~sec Transcription and Translation of the target genes ~minutes Accumulation of the Protein Product ~hours Hence, when considering network dynamics of protein levels, the transcription factor activity levels can be considered to be in steady state.\nTranscription networks are extremely modular in nature. (GFP from jellyfish) is widely used in experiments. Promoter of effect A + Gene of effect B → mechanism that causes a when B is true. Promoters and genes are generally interchangeable. This fact also means that these networks can evolve rapidly.\nThe arrows in the transcription network evolve on a much faster timescale than the coding regions of the genes (time scale of many generations).\nEach transcription factor acts primarily in one mode for its target genes, as either an activator or repressor. However, the input mode of regulation [of a gene] is often mixed.\nInput Functions The strength of the effect of a transcription factor on a target gene is escribed by an input function.\nX regulates Y : the number of molecules of protein Y produced per unit time is a function of the concentration of X in its active form $X^{*}$.\nRate of production $Y = f(X^*)$.\nA useful function that realistically describes many gene input functions is called the Hill function. $$ f(X^*) = \\beta\\frac{X^{*n}}{\\Kappa^{n} + X^{*n}} $$\nK : activation coefficient, which has units of concentration. It defines the concentration of active X needed to significantly activate expression.\n$X^* = K$ : half-maximal expression.\n$K$ is mainly determined by the chemical affinity between $X$ and its binding site on the promoter.\n$\\beta$ : maximal promoter activity. It is reached when $X^* \\gg K$.\nThe Hill Coefficient $n$ determines the steepness of the input function. For larger n, the function is more step-like.\nUsually, input functions are moderately steep: n=1-4.\nFor a repressor, the hill function is a decreasing function.\nHence, each arrow in the network can be thought to carry at least three numbers: $\\beta, K, n$. These numbers can be readily tuned during evolution.\n$K$ : Can be varied if the position of the binding site is changed. $\\beta$ : can be tuned by the mutations in the RNAp binding site. Laboratory evolution experiments show that when placed in a new environment, bacteria can accurately tune these numbers within several hundred generations to reach optimal expression levels. Thus, these numbers are under selection pressure and can heritably change over many generations if environments change.\nMany genes have a nonzero minimal expression level, called the gene\u0026rsquo;s basal expression level. It can be described by adding a $\\beta_0$ term.\nThe essence of the input functio n is a transition between low and high values, with a characteristic threshold $K$.\nWe can hence approximate the input function with a logic approximation. It can be expressed as : $f(X^{ * }) = \\beta\\theta(X^{ * }\u0026gt; K)$. It is equivalent to a Hill function with $n \\rightarrow \\infty$.\nFor a repressor: $f(X^{ * }) = \\beta \\theta(X^{ * } \u0026lt; K)$ .\nMulti-dimensional input functions:\n$f(X^{ * }, Y^{ * }) = \\beta\\theta(X^{ * } \u0026gt; K_x)\\theta(Y^{ * }\u0026gt; K_y)$ ~ X AND Y $f(X^{ * }, Y^{ * } ) = \\beta\\theta(X^{ * } \u0026gt; K_x + Y^* \u0026gt; K_y)$ ~ X OR Y SUM input function: $f(X^{ * }, Y^{ * }) = \\beta_xX^{ * }+ \\beta_yY^{ * }$. More complex functions with many inputs\u0026hellip; Dynamics \u0026amp; Response Time $$ X + S_x \\rightarrow X^{} \\ X^ \\rightarrow P_y + mRNA \\rightarrow Protein_Y $$\n$S_x$ is the activation signal for $X$. $P_y$ is a promoter of gene $Y$.\nThe concentration of a protein in a cell is regulated by two processes: degradation ($\\alpha_{deg}$) and dillution ($\\alpha_dil{}$). The total removaal rate is hence: $\\alpha = \\alpha_{dil} + \\alpha_{deg}$. This gives us the the following dynamic equation of the concentration of a protein Y: $dY/dt = \\beta + \\alpha Y$. Solving this equation yields the steady state concentration of the protein as: $Y_{st} = \\beta / \\alpha$.\nThis is however a simplified model. The regulation of protein in reality happens at every step of the production. While the protein is contructed in cohesion with the mRNA, various micro-steps have their own regulatory mechanisms.\nResponse Time The response time is a measure of speed of a dynamical process. It is the time needed to reach halfway $T_{1/2}$ between the inital and the final levels in a dynamical process. For an example, if we assume that the protein production of Y has come to a halt. Hence, $\\beta = 0$. The dynamical equation then simplifies to: $$ Y(t) = Y_{st}e^{- \\alpha t} $$ Solving the above equation yields: $$ Y(t_{response}) = Y_{st} / 2 \\newline T_{1/2} = log(2) / \\alpha $$ This leads us to the following realisations:\nRemoval rate $\\alpha$ determines the response time. Fast removal allowes for rapid changes in the concentration of the protein. The production rate $\\beta$ determines the steady state concentration, but not the respone time. Proteins with big $\\alpha$ also need large $\\beta$ to sustain their steady state rates. This might seeem completely futile, but this tradeoff can be used for rapidy changing concentration of certain proteins.

In that case, the system introduces new set-points that can be realistically acheieved. This is called allostasis.\nBrain-science revolutions:\nbrain 1.0 : neurons and synapses brain 2.0: brains and associative memory brain 3.0: biological minds Brain 1.0 : Neurons and Synapses Brain is required for adaptation. If the environmental changes outpace the changes in the genetic material that causes viable responses; pure genetic adaptation is no longer a vaible option. Physarum polycephalum : Smart behaviour in slime mold. It can solve mazes by exploring its environment by extending a network of cytoplasmic matter and leaving chemical trails — essentially doing a non-backtracking random walk. Neurons as computational units Synapses: Electrical Chemical Axons have Myelin Sheaths have interruptions called nodes of Ranvier. The signal then jumps faster between the nodes. The distance between two such nodes has to be optimized for reliable transfer. Two evolutionary scenarios for the evolution of neutrons: Single-origin hypothesis: in some organisms there was a loss of nervous systems — Homologous systems. Multiple origin hypothesis: neural abilities evolved in different organisms at different times — Convergent Systems. Electrical code: Creation of an electrical code in neurons relies in 3 distinct modules of proteins: Ion homeostasis: creates the potential energy for the action potential. Transduction: transduces sensory and intercellular into electrical code. Propogation: propagates the electrical signals along neurons. Key tasks of neuronal ion homeostasis: maintianing a negative voltage across the membrane to power action potentials — P-type ATPases maintaining low levels of cytoplasmic $Ca^{2+}$, since it regulates intra-cellular communications. Transduction. the first step in neural signalling: Of the many protein families involved in transduction, only two are metazoan (multi-cellular) novelties. Propagation: local electrical signals will attenuate over space. To propogate over large distance, neurons use ion channels respond to voltage itself, called voltage-gated ion channels. Action potentials are used across different biological systems to mediate processes: Bacterial biofilms also use regenerative potential changes to coordinate colony growth, etc\u0026hellip; Evolution of voltage-gated sodium channels: The key change allowed this development was the evolution of voltage-gated sodium channles (Nav) from preexisting voltage-gated calcium channels (Cav). $Na^+$ does not broadly triggert cellular signalling pathways as $Ca^{2+}$ does. $K^+$ ion channels are then used for traspondence of signals across the neutron. Chemical synapses and electrical synapses: Electrical system is faster but the chemical one is more precise and cn be moduled in a variety of ways. Each step of the chemical signalling can be moduled in Chemical signalling. Evolution of synapse: synapses likely originated from cell junctions in early metazoans. The first brain: Enteric NS vs Central NS All animals that have neurons have an EWS. However, not all animals that have neurons have a CNS. An ENS with similar features occurs in cnidaria [TODO] and bilateraa [TODO], but a CNS occurs only in bilateria (although not all).

Important: Fish have life-long neurogenesis. First tests for Cognitive abilities: Numeric Learning\nLarge-brained females learns better Male fishes learn \u0026ldquo;equally bad\u0026rdquo;. Large-brained females are better at reversal learning. Brain size and survival:\n\u0026ldquo;Large Fish Collider Vienna\u0026rdquo; Predator Inspection — side swimming motion that they use to scan large field of view. Maybe also signals the predator that it has been spotted by the prey and a surprise attack would not work. Small-brained fishes inspect longer, and across wider distances. Brain size and conflict resolution: They are territorial and would recognize a confined space as their territory. Large-brained femaled prefer more colourful males, and vice-versa.\nOptomotor Test: Put stripes in the field of view (a cylinder) — move it, and the eye follows it with a reflex action. This test can be used to figue out the miniumum resolvable resolution, by varying the size of the stripes. Opsin gene expression + Optomotor test can be used to test color sensitvity. Are small-brained guppies \u0026lsquo;bad guppies\u0026rsquo;? Small-brained fishes: Similar body condition Similar swimming abilities Faster juvenile growth Similar adult size Similar digestive efficiency More offsprings Better innate immunity Survive longer Small-braines individuals live longer when kept individually. Predation vs brain size: Post-doc Project I: Genetics and evolution of social behavior in Drosophila and zebrafish Susana Varela Introduced Drosophila to Rui\u0026rsquo;s lab. Learning by watching or passive learning is called social learning. It is not the same as community learning. The learner does not experience the task itself, just observes and perceives it. Environment complexity and the evolution of social behaviour and social cognition Addition of same agents to a single food source will increase the cognition compleity of the foraging task — Environmental complexity. What is a non-social interaction? : Non-cooperation is non-social. (lecturer\u0026rsquo;s opinion) Neural and psychological mechanism of information: flowchart LR Input --\u003e Encoding --\u003e Storage --\u003e Retreival Adequete cognitive abilities are a sum of : Social and Non-social competence. The social intellegence and social brain hypothesis posit that group living generates the selective forces that drive the evolution of enhanced cognitive abilities and brain size. General-purpose cognitive mechanism has strong selective pressure on social behaviour. The available evidence supporting these hyposthesis is still scarce. All evidence for this hypothesis has been based on comparative studies. All fishes prefer circles (control) but Shoal selected lines prefer shoals more than non-seleceted lines. Post-doc Project II: Social modulation of adult neurogenesis in zebrafish Magda Teles The dogma: nerve cells don\u0026rsquo;t regenerate in adults. The dogma died.I Different prolifereation in different organismic species. In fishes, all the brain regions are proliferated.

Cortisol was shown to control this proliferation. The presence of cortisol itself is linked to the position of the animal in its social hierarchy. The effects of the social environment were independent of circulating cortisol levels.

[Monday] GWAS: Genome Wide Association Study and it can be used to quantify the abundance and location of genes in comparison to using QTL (qunatitative trait locus) , which just gives you the expression of the gene (its position on the genome). We use EWS, a chemical mutagen to indiuce the mutations. Mapping by Sequencing: We sequence the mutated and look for particular mutated sites using GWASP.

Concerned mainly with understandiong vsriation within species Typically one focuses on the evolution of one or two loci at a time. Evolutionary Forces Mutations (mistakes are unavoidable) Natural selections (there is extensive variability in fitness within populations) Migration (populations are structured) Genetic Drift (every population is finite, and subject to stochastic events) Note: Evolution involves the interplay with all the forces.\nHardy-Weinberg equilibrium: first milestone in Population Genetics in sexual diploids. Mutation rate is around $10^{-9}$ per nucleotide site per generation. Effects of mutations Neutral (don\u0026rsquo;t affect fitness) Effectively neutral (-1 \u0026lt; $N_s$ \u0026lt; 1) Beneficial (causes adaptation) Deleterious (cause degeneration) Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution Kimura\u0026rsquo;s neutral model: Assumes that most variation observed within and across species can be explained by an equilibrium between variation generating mechanisms — mutation — and a variation erosion mechanism — genetic drift.\nOne such test is pN/pS: the ratio of observed non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphism, compared to that expected if one assumes uniform mutation rates across the gene.\npN/pS should be 1 under neutral evolution.\nSelection as an evolutionary force — constant fitness.\nFrequency-dependent selection Here fitness depend on the frequencies of genotypes in the population. \u0026ldquo;A rare phenotype may be more popular in terms of sexual preference.\u0026rdquo; — negative frequency dependedent selection. There is also positive frequency based selection, which is the more obvious case. Probability of Fixation of Mutations under Selection Not every good allele is fixed and not every bad one is lost!\nTime of Fixation of a Benefitial Mutation: A mutation that confers a 1% benefit will take ~200 generations to reach a frequency close to fixation.\nThe decrease in populations , deleterious mutations can depart from their equilibrium frequency, be lost or go to fixation, all by stochastic drift.\nClonal interference: adaptations muttations arise faster tahn the time it takes for an individual mutation to get fixed.\nWhen can populations avoid clonal interference? By using sexual recombination.\nUsing Wright-Fisher model to understand the mechanisms of evolution Tiago Paixão Genetic Drift Mutation Selection Experimental evolution applied to cell biology Marco Fumasoni Cell Perturbations: Gene deletion Paralog (Express something which doesn\u0026rsquo;t bwlong there) Ortholog (Insert a foreign gene) Ancestral allele Partial loss of function (disturb a gene partially) The \u0026lsquo;Evolutionary repair\u0026rsquo; approach — as a methodology to study evolution.

Genetic Drift results in fixation of alleles inspite of the fluctuating frequencies fo alleles.\nGenome Erosion - reduction to the extreme, which often leads to coupling of the bacteria with a certain host.\nDisadvantages: Rapid evolution, extreme drift Fixation of deleterious mutations due to drift Irreversible loss of genes Muller\u0026rsquo;s Ratchet: is genetic erosion a one way street to genetic oblivion? Becuase in large and unrestricted populations — deleterious mutations are removed through recombination and these dewleterious mutations are less likely to get fixed by genetic drift. In small, clonal populations — no way to recombine and more likely to fix and repeat cycle. There are some mechanisms that are know, that help these bacterias avoid this trap: Compensatory mutations Just-enough recombination Strong purifying selection Symbiont replacement (doom for microbe, but not the host) C - value paradox\nPopulation size in eukaryotes: as in bacteria, effective population size (Ne) is postulated to strongly effect genome composition.\nEukaryotes have smaller populations than prokaryotes. General trend upheld but variation depending on taxonomic group. Whole Gene Duplication\nHorizontal Gene transfer: What. is it? How common?\nUpto 30% of thr genome of a bacteria may be acquired by HGT. Pan genome of HGT: a prokaryotic species have no single defined gene set.

Some Historical Perspective **Preformation: ** ​\tEpigenesis: The theory of how the seed evolves into a lively being.\nTwo kinds of cells (Theory of Germ Plasm):\nGerm cells: The cells that are used for reproduction. Zygote? Somatic cells: make the body. Mutations in the Somatic cells are not passed on to the next generation. Pluripotency/totipotency:\n​\tThe Spemann-Mangold Experiment:\nThe experiments at Thomas Hunt Morgan\u0026rsquo;s lab used Deosophila to show the inheritance of traits that were particularly present on the genetic material of one of the parent. They could definatively claim that the genetic encoding was present on the chromosomes using their experiments.\nSomatic Cell Nuclear Transfer:\nGenes control embryonic development: This was illustrated using the \u0026ldquo;Hox Genes\u0026rdquo;, where they modified a single gene, with whose modification, they were able to indice the development of many legs in Drosophila.\nZebra Fish is used as a model organism because you can see the whole embryonic development process clearly under the microscope.\nMorphogens A morphogen is a molecule that controls the formation of patterns during embryonic development through their non-unifrom distribution.\nMorphogenes were identified that control the patterns during embryonic development stages.\nInduction Two kinds of Induction Instructive: Tissue is told what to become. Permissive: Tissue knows what to become already, it wait for its trigger. Generic Notes Stem cells can divide forever in a culture.\nGenetic Material Transfer\nCas9 and Cas13\nThe emerging technologies and approaches applied to the study of development Moisés Mallo How do you know what is going on inside cells or tissues? Identification of the activity of single genes/proteins and their combination:\nGlobally: Northern blot, Western blot, RT-PCR Spatial resolution: In situ hybridization, immunochemistry Western Blot: Seperates proteins based on the size of their sequences. The protein is denatured and folded with sphericity using a chemical agent before placing it in the gel.\nMassive Paralle Sequencing:\nCapturing dynamic processes of cellular lineages:\nRNA velocity Compares splices and non-spliced RNA sequences Diffusion maps Searches for the nearest neighbor graphs in the transcriptomes of consecutive stages to create orderly sequences and branches Uses data from developmental series Mechanisms of Morphogenesis Lab Elias H Barriga Some Xenopus laevis discoveries and gossip X. laevis and X. tropicalis: The development temperatures are different. For Tropicalis, it can be controlled quite well. The origin of these frogs is in Africa. In the wild, they are very agressive and at many places they have become an invasive species. Xenbase Xenopus are websites that are databases for Xenopus. How this started? : Luigi Galvani and the frog mustle experiment(s). Electric fields drive neural crest migration ex vivo. The Xenopus Pregnancy Test Inject frogs with urine sample while them swim in a sterile buffer. The sampl was injected near the overies of the femaile Xenopus.\nOnly effective for detection if the pregnancy was about 3-5 weeks.\nRelease of frog eggs would indicate a pregnancy.\nLancelot Hogben established the first Xenopus colony at the London School of Economics in 1927.\nExploited the fact that Xenopus females laid eggs in response to human chrionic gondatropin.\nDown to Embroyos The nucleus from the same species can be transplanted into an egg and it can develop to a tadpole and beyond.\n\u0026lsquo;Something\u0026rsquo; happens later when the cells get differentiated that makes the nucleus unable to be reprogrammed.\nLater in 2012, John B. Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka got the Nobel Prize for their work in understanding \u0026rsquo;the something\u0026rsquo; - which today is called nuclear reprogramming.\nRobert Briggs and Thomas J King did the very first nuclar transplantation in Xenopus.\nSpemann-Mongold organizer 1924: they discovered the Spemann-Mongold organizer which is a portion of the embroyo that induces other cells to organize specifically. The motor of morphogenesis Fate maps: put fluorophores in a particular locations and track where they end up during morphogenesis. Synchronising tissue morphogenesis Cell migration involves active translocation of a cell or a group of cells from one position to another and it is essential in a wide range of physiological as well as pathological contexts.

Best way to cut the embroyo is from the eye lash of a new born baby. Xenopus leaves: First described by the French naturalist Francois Marie Daudin in 1803. The name means: the clawed African frog. Michail Fischbergy recognised that this [urine injection] allowed for frog embroyology to be run throughout the year. Nuclear reprogramming experiment Kill the OG nucleus with high intensity UV radiation. Add the required nucleus from the somatic cells of the to-be-cloned organism. How to work with Xenopus? Squeeze to release the eggs. Put the female for rest for 3 months. Kill the male frog, and chop the testis. Make testis soup and mix it with the eggs. The Eggs are fertilized!

Turnover rate approx. 3-5 days (the time taken by the cell to be born and to die). Small intestine: is the largest mucosal surface of the body and also the fastest-renewing epithelium in mammals (3-5 days). The cells in the samll intestines form in the crypt and migrate over the vilius to the extrusion part, where they form mucas and eventually die. The gut epithelium is a dynamic tissue barrier. You have different stresses: Chemicals - toxins Mechanical - pressure, stretch Biological - pathogens How is the balance achieved between division, migration, and extrusion ? The cell-division only takes place in the crypt, it cannot take place in the extrusion. Hence, small intestine cancers are extremey rare (there are many other reassons like a short lifecycle). By running biophysical model we can simulate the density and velocity profiles. By comparing with the experimental data, it was found that active migration was a necessary component in the dynamics of these migrating cells. Gut epithelium is under tension because the cell migration is pulling on the cell-cell junctions. Laser ablations are used to map junctional tensions.

[deadline] Introduction to the Cell Cycle Raquel Oliveira the DNA molecule: Long-term storage of information\nreading transmission The human karyotype: 23 chromosome pairs\nDuring cell division, you seperate the chromatins, not the chromosomes.\nThe human body experiences ~10, 000 trillion cell divisions during the lifetime.\nWhy do cells divide?\nReproduction: the only time when the chromosome pairs reseperate Regeneration: Starfishes are really good at it, Human liver can regenerate from its $1/3^{rd}$ proportion. Cell Rejuvination Most cells are usually in the $G_0$ phase.\nThe \u0026ldquo;must do\u0026rdquo; of cell division:\nreplicate their DNA and organelles segregate its contenet equally in the two daughter cells ensure the right order of events Cell mass grows linearly during the cell cycle, whereas, the DNA content looks like a step function.\nThe search for the master cell cycle regulators:\nBiochemical approach: Cells specialized for rapid and synchronomus division (exhibiying natural blocks) Genetic approach: Cells in whiuch genetic manipulations are straightforward. Cells displaying prominent control points. Eventuall, the two branches were merged. A temperature sensitive mutant: The mutant will die due to temperature change. Its a way of implementing conditional muatation in the experiment cycle.\nHaploid yeast: Its easier to screen for mutants.\nPermissive (low) temperature: You see all stages of the cell cycle.\nRestrict (high) temperature: Cells are stuck at the $G_1$ phase.\nCyclin + Cdk complex are essential for cell division in frog egg. The 2001 Nobel Prize for given for the discovery of key regulators of the cell division cycle.\nRegulators of the cell cycle:\nG1: Cyclin D + Cdk 4 and Cyclin D + Cdk6 S. Cyclin E + Cdk2 G2: Cyclin A + Cdk2 M: Cyclin B + Cdk1 Whwn something decreases very sharply, its probaly being regulated by the degradation os something.\nDNA replication \u0026ldquo;inside a cell\u0026rdquo; Marco Fumasoni There are restrictions when we need cell replication inside the cell, in contrast to say a PCR:\nReplication is done with only one cycle.\nUnder-replication / Over-replication of the DNA can lead to misfolding of the chromatins.\nIn bacteria, the DNA replication is not very time controlled, hence the problem of over-replication does not hinder the development of the cell.\nOrigin is liciened to \u0026ldquo;ORC\u0026rdquo; : Origin Recognition Complex, which recognises the Helicase.\nHelicase: Enzyme that unpacks the genetic material. In this context, it opens up the double Helix.\nWhat makes certain Origins slower? (Some origins can fire but they don\u0026rsquo;t)\nTo prevent the activation of certain Origins, the cell can use checkpoints like the regulation of DDK. mec1 modification can express DDK and r+then control the oroduction of DDK.\nMitosis Raquel Oliveira Riddle: Two blind man go shopping for socks\nThere was a man who went to the mall and he bought 3 pairs of red socks and 3 pairs of white socks. Another man who already bought 3 pairs of red socks and 3 pairs of white socks came back to return his 3 pairs of red socks and 3 pairs of white socks. They are both blind. As they were walking they bumped into each other. All the socks scattered around the floor, but each pair remained held together by a rubber band. Nobody helped them pick it up except each other, but in 3 minutes they both put them back altogether. Each man ended up with the same colors of socks he started with: six red and six white. How is that possible if they are blind?\nHow do cells divide?\nKangaroo-Rat from Australia as our model organiosm, since it has only 12 to 13 chromosomes.\nInsects (like the Drosophilia) divide for 13 generations in a single \u0026ldquo;Pangea cell\u0026rdquo;. Hence, the division is extremenly synchronised.\nQuestions The constraint of space. Can\u0026rsquo;t we have a bigger nucleus? So that more space allows for less crowding bias.\nHow much force does the spindles apply when they are pulling apart the chromatins?\nHow do they [the spindles] know when its the right time to pull ?\nHow do Chromosomes find their way?\nSeveral models have been proposed. Mathematically, it was found that a random microtuble search of the space would not be enough.\nThe number of mechanisms that promote effcient chromosome capture are about 6-7 in number and still increasding.\nAnswers The correct position to grab the chromosome is done using mechanosensing. A tension-sensitive error correction mechanism is used.\nMerotelic attachment is a problematic case and is responsible for most errors during copying.\nMetaphase $\\rightarrow$ Anaphase : Separase is activated by the APC. It is the primary regulatory mechanism.\nThe seperation mechanism relies on sensing all microtubles attachment to kinetochores.\n~700 pN force is applied by the spindle.\nCell Division in Developement Eurico Morais-de-Sá Cell Polarity: Eg: Neurons; Edourard Van Beneden and Carl Rabl.\n~75% of human diseases have analogues/homologues in Drosophila.\n\u0026ldquo;They don\u0026rsquo;t eat much, reproduce like mad, and never demand an ethics committee\u0026rdquo; - whyfiles.org\nPAR-genes controls the cell polarity. The spatial clue is the Sperm centrosome.\nMaking polarized cells:\nflowchart TD Spatial-Cue--Symmetry-breaking--\u003e2(Distribution of Polarity determinants) 2 --\u003e X Cell Polarity is observed in multiple cell contexts.\nWhy do we care about epithelial organisation? Epithelial barriers are essential for organism compartmentalization.\n\u0026ldquo;Apical-basal\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;inside and outside\u0026rdquo; maybe\nEpithelial cell devision in the basal part is spatially oriented. We see Planar spindle orientation that precedes planar cell division.\nEpithelial cell division:\nAsymmetric division: Different fates/ Tissue thickening Symmetric division: Identical fates/Tissue spreading The Position of the centrosomes determine the positioning of the spindle orientation.\nHertwig \u0026ldquo;long-axis\u0026rdquo; rule states that cells prefer to divide perpendicular to the long axis of the mitotic spindle.\nPolarity oscillations maintains tissue architecture.\nDay 2 Tublin Cytoskeleton/ Centrosomes (general principles) Mónica Bettencourt Dias All functions of the cell kind of depend on the cytoskeleton.\nTublins: are the functional building blocks.\nFilament polarity largely determines the complex structure of cells and its polaritty.\nMicrotubles direct vesicle trafficked by acting as tracks for motor proteins. Golgi and lysosomes move towards minus ends while secretory vescicles move towards at the plus end.\nYou have motor proteins moving across this polar track:\nDyneins: Kinesins: Dybamic Instability is driven by GTP hydrolysis. GTP units like to be straight but the GDP units like to be curved.\nCellular factors regulate Dynamc Instability: Cyclines and Cdks also change the structure of the cytoskeleton dynamics.\nAggregation follows bulk polymerization dynamics.\nThe cell controls where polymers from using nucleating factors.\nCentrosomes contains $\\gamma$-tublin which acts as nucleating sites for Tublin filamentation.\nHenneguy-Lenhossek hypothesis: Centrosomes can form spindles as well as flagella. They also form cilia.\nMost human cells have cellia, hence, problems with cillia results in a myriad of seemingly unconnected pathologies. Like Retinal degeneration, Kidney Cysts, Cognitive defects.\nCillia Assembly: The centrosomes goes to the membrane and starts assembling a microtuble structure called the Cillium.\nCentrioles are not necessary for cell division. Cell divisions can happen without it. Many organism families have dropped it altogether.\nA centrosome has two centrioles.\nChromosomes can also nucleate microtubles, hence, centrosoles are redundant for cell division.\nHuman/Mice Cells need Centrioles for cell division.\nKinesisns can also bind together to focus microtuble spindles.\nMore than one centrosome can cause a variety of cancers because they can interfere during cell division and cause aneuploidy.\nCells adapt to multiple centrosomes by clustering them, especially cancer cells.\nSenior IGC Fellow: Pedro\nBacteria have something similar to Actin and Tubilin.\nCancer Centrosomes \u0026amp; Cancer Mitosis\nAsymetric cell division\nAneuploidy\nIncreased/Decreased signalling plateform\nIncreased Microtuble directed polarization\nAltered Rho GTPhase activity andd Altered Focal adhesion turnover\nDay 3 Membrane Protein Proteostasis Colin Adrian 30% of proteins encoded are pushed into the Endoplasmic Reticulum, and are membrane or secretary proteins.\nWe have organelles to sepertate many different chemical processes : to compartmentalize them.\nFluid Mosaic Model:1972 to present\nTransmembrane domains are alpha helices that can be used to classify memebrane proteins\nPolytopic membrane: TODO\nCharged residues are used to emable polymerization or dimerisation.\n~50% of membrane is composed of transmembrane proteins.\nMembrane proteins are often difficult to fold.

Addition of sugars.\nRamanujan S. Hegde for Membrane Protein studies.\nThe signal sequence hypothesis: As the polypeptide emerges from the ribosome, it is sensed and inserted in the membrane as it folds.\nSignal peptide or transmembrane domains are needed to recognize a transmembrane protein. Tail Anchored (TA) proteins have a very short C terminal and no signallling domain, hence co-translation is not possible.\nPost-translation; TODO\nLipid Droplets: Intracellular stores of triglycerides \u0026amp; cholestryl esters Organalles: They have their own specialised proteiome.

Also study proteins using variety of techniques like ML and computational design. Moplecular Interactions in Biomolecules Non-covalent interactions modelled via Lennard-Jones, consists of van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds. Two neutral atoms in close proximity get polarised ! Van der waals radius is r1 + r2 and is the point where the repulsive interactions become dominent. Hydrogen bonds can be thought of as a dipole-dipole interaction but on a molecular scale. Iconic interactions are the strongest, however, water ions severly reduce electrostatic interaction. In vacuum its ~50 kJ/mol, whereas in water its ~6 kJ/mol.

Polar amino acids can form hydrogen bonds with itself and other amino acids. They are also hydrophobic. Negatively and positively charged amino acids. Their sidechains are charged at pH=7.

It forms by making H-bonds between Hydrogen and oxygen.\n$\\beta$-sheets form hydrogen bonds with its whole backbone.\nUsually the alpha and beta sheets are sometimes misaligned and imperfect.\nAlpha-helix\nIn the alpha-helix, the carbonyl oxygen of residue \u0026ldquo;i\u0026rdquo; forms a hydrogen bond with the amide of the residue \u0026ldquo;i+4\u0026rdquo;. There are only right handed alpha-helixes, except for a handful of exceptions. Beta-sheets\nCan be wither parallel and antiparallel. They have roughly the same binding energy. In a beta-sheet, carbonyl oxygen and amides form hydrogen bonds between the strands, i.e between amino acids far away from each other in primary sequence. Proteins can be composed of one of the two secondary structures or be mixed.\nBeyond Secondary Structures The tertiary structure, which is the three-dimensional organisation of the secondary structure elements. It is also referred to as the protein fold. Quaternary structures refers to the association of different polypeptide chains (subunits) into a multinumeric complex. Protein domains are fundamental units of tertiary structue. it forms an independnt structural domin. They are often units of function. Domains have the same fold yet different amino acid sequences. Protein domains are very stable to mutations. ANd they have been selected via evolution for the very specific reason. The stability of the folded structure results primarily from the hydrophobic regions folding in together. Two proteins with different sequences can have the same sequence. Conformations and Folding Protein conformational changes does not require breaking bonds. The peptide bond has partial double bond character and therefore are sterically hindered. Protein folding induces conformational changes in the backbone. The backbone torsion angles $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ determine that conformation of the protein chain. The Ramachandran diagram define the restrictions on backbone conformation. $\\psi$ : TODO $\\phi$ : TODO L: Left handed helix You see a lot of Glycines in loops as they are flexible because of the absence of any side chains. Prolines are in Cis conformation so they ususally \u0026ldquo;kink\u0026rdquo; the alpha-helix. Not generally found anywhere else. Secondary structural elements are conected to form simple motifs. Given motifs, you can create many folds. The interactions between the atoms in a protein control the folding of the protein into a well defined structure (native structure): Thermodynamic hyposthesis of protein folding. It was demonstrated by the famous Anfinsen Experiment which opened the folded structure of a protein and allowed it to relax in a controlled manner to recover the folded structure, This information is encoded in their amino acid sequence. Evolution and Protein Structure by Casper Goverde Reading Suggestion: The Molecules of Life (Chapter 5)\nProtein structures are conserved during evolution while amino acids vary.\nMotifs that are crutial for protein folding are conserved during evolution.\nYou can use protein globins to classify species at the molecular level.\nDue to different selection pressures amd line seperation, protein sequences diverge between species.\nHow to quantify differences in sequences? Use a substitution matrix (BLOSUM). We use a matrix of probailities. Each entry in the matrix is called a substitution score ($S_{ij}$). The higher the score (positive), the more likely is the substition.\nThe BLOSUM substitution score is the logarithm of the likelihood that one aa in a protein is replaced by another during evolution.\n$S_{ij}$ is related to the frequency of substititon over random chance.\nBLAST (Basic Local Alignmnet Search Tool) : Identify novel proteins, find functional relationships and sequence motifs and patterns.\nTOP-7 is the first synthetic motif.\nThe most used measure is the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD).\nDomains are \u0026ldquo;self contained units\u0026rdquo; that can be placed in different proteins.\nPyMol Excercises Superimposition is done by fitting the polypeptide backbone of your target protein on the reference protein. Best fit will have smallest Rms (root mean square) value.\nWhat is PSIPRED?\nProtein crystals have a high solvent content, which you can also observe as large spaces between the proteins in the Electron density maps.\nDay 2\nX-ray Crystallography The further out spots the higher the resolution of the protein structure.\nThe dark ring ~3Å is caused by water molecules un the crystal.\nflowchart LR crystals --\"x-rays\"--\u003e diffraction-pattern --\u003e electron-density-maps--\u003eatomic-structure atomic-structure --refinement--\u003ediffraction-pattern Methods to check crystallization conditions for proteins: Hanging Drop- and Sitting Drop- Vapour Diffusion.\nTypical concentration for X-ray diffraction: TODO\nHigh B-factor: low confidence in position of atom, which also corresponds to low electron densities.\nIn 2020 the number of structures in PDB reached 171,916.\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Resonance Frequency in NMR: $$ R_f = \\frac{2 \\mu_BB_o}{h} $$\nResonance frequency depends on nature of the nucleus and its chemical environment.\nResonance frequency is directly proportional to the strength of the external applied magnetic field.\nWe commonly use $H^1$ and $C^{13}$ for labelling as they are NMR active.\nNuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE): Provides information on spatial proximity of protons in protein.

There are multiple .pdb files for a single protein corresponsiong to all the different experiments done with the protein. They might have different resolutions, and precision.

The FOM is GDT (Global Distance Test). AlphaFold 1 was the first to combine Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) and Deep Neural Networks. MSA finds similar sequence across different species, aligns, and then find \u0026ldquo;suitable mutations\u0026rdquo; or the set of all possible mutations (coevolution). If something mutates to a more positive base, the other base can mutate to something more negative, but not positive. We calculate distance matrix -\u0026gt; Correlation matrix. A neural network can approximate any function, given that your neural network has arbitrary width and we have an infinite dataset. AlphaFold also uses a Convolutional neural networks to recognise patterns. Output is the distance matrix, and the distance matrix of the two dihedral angles $\\phi$ and $\\psi$.

Specificity is the ratio of binding affinities. They are theoreticlly not related. Innature, Higher affinity implies lower specificity. Binding sites usually have a hydrophobic core and then on the rim, you have bases that have specificity. Whwn fraction $f$ is half in a reaction, out dissociation constant $K_D$ equals the ligand concentration $L$. Univeral binding isotherm is expressed in terms of $K_D$. Drug Binding by Proteins Find a Lead compound. That bind to the receptor. They are usually not very specific and affinative. Iterate the lead compound to imrove specificity and affinity. Competative inhibitors: $IC_{50}$ is the concentration of the inhibitor that reduces the binding of the protein by half maximal value. $IC_{50}s$ are used rather than a single value because the activity of the drug may vary between the population just because of random mutations. Energetics of the Binding: There is entropic loss but enthalpic gain. $\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S$ The affinity for a protein for a ligand is characterized by the dissociation constant, $K_D$.

DNA replication proceeds only in one direction. It is because of the presence of phosphtes on the one side only, which is required for catalysis. The replication movement creates a \u0026ldquo;replication fork\u0026rdquo;, which leads to a leading strand (continuous synthesis) and lagging strand (discontinuous sequence). The fragments on the lagging strand are vcalled Okazaki fragments. Replisome; Average human chromosome: 150 Mbp Average Eukaryotic replisome speed: ~50 nt/s It will take 400 hours for the replication to occur. Hence there are 100s of origins for replication on a chromosome. How to identify DNA replication origins? (which are parts ) : Chop DNA, make some kind of loops with URA3. Only segments with Origins replicate and survive to grow into colonies. Deep Sequencing: sequencing of DNA at different time points gives rise to a frequency distribution, where the modes give you the Origin points. This method can also give you the speed of the fork , etc. With Cloning we can find all potential Origin sites, however, with Deep Sequencing, you find the Origins that are being actually used by the cell. End replication problem: Each time a cell divides, the chromosomes should be shortened. Finally the chromosomes should and be damaged. The telomere: Its a end point sequence that protects linear DNA from degradation by replacing the shortened DNA bases. Telomerase: the enzyme that does the replacement. Some cancers can express Telomerase to bypass the cell division limit. Telomers are repeated sequences. The T-loop hypothesis states that the end of the DNA strand loops back to itself to make a loop, so as to not signal as a broken DNA strand. The end-looping region is the Trlomer region. Different organisms also use different mechanisms to deal with end poins of its genetic material.

Universality: an idea of the epistemic validity of Science Locality:c science is influences by its local conditions of production Globally: the circulation of scientific knowledge, materials, and practices from one location to other. Thomas Hunt Morgan, American was responsible for coming up with Drosophilia model systems. Morgan get the Nobel Prize for \u0026ldquo;The Mechanisms of Mendelian Heridity\u0026rdquo;. He inbred flies in the lab in a bio-reactor to amplify rare mutations. The first mutant he discovered was controlling the eye color of the fly. He also found that mutations co-occur. So you can put mutations into discrete groups based on co-occurance. Chromosomes can cross over which results in recombination of genes. Recombination rates can be used as a measure of proximity. From this methotend to kill you, its d they were able to create a linear photo-map of the genes. This gets the PI a nobel prize. This also cements the Chromosome-gene theory for genetics. Gene is the unit of Structure, Function, Recombination, and Mutation. Morgan runs a tight ship of the Boss and the Bois. Chromosomes are proteins + DNA. Its Nucleoproteins. H.J. muller invents the Balanced Lethal Assay. He was able to show that their is a linear relationship between X-ray dosage and the amount of mutations. He got the nobel prize for this.

Hence $ACF(k) \\space or \\space G(k)$ refers to the $k^{th}$ channel.\nThe software module that manages the correlation is treated as a separate object entity. That means, each instance of the module completely describes the acquisition, calculation, and output of the data as required for a time series. All the different correlator modules, except the Logarithmic_Correlator derive from a base class called the Linear_Correlator_Base. This class defines a series of operations (functions) that are implemented by all different linear correlators types.\nThe subsequent sections will explain the simple model used - Simple Correlator System, then explain the different correlation module designs.\nIntroduction to Sources[^Incomplete] The primary sources used for this article and the code development are listed in this table:\nS.

TTL-gt is also the minimum resolution of time available for autocorrelation calculation. Simple Correlator System The counter module is responsible for counting the pulses with a gate time $TTL-gt$.\nAs soon as the sample time $TTL-gt$ is over, the PI-t (Periodic Interrupt timer) signals a transfer of the collected photon counts to the Data Processing Unit (DPU). It should be noted here that during the transfer of data from the counter module to the DPU — the counter is inactive until the transfer is done and the counter is reset for the next counting interval. This **dead time $t_{d}$ ** gives rise to an error. $$ Error = counting \\space dead \\space time / sampling \\space time * 100% $$ ==It might be possible to estimate this dead time by analyzing the clock cycles used by the transfer function.==\nIt is also essential that the time required for the computation of datum passed by the Counter to the DPU is less than the gate time $TTL-gt$. This is because the DPU needs to complete the (This point is also emphasized in Magatti \u0026amp; Ferri, 2001).\nHence, any implementation of a Correlator module that models the above schematics, must satisfy the following conditions:\nThe dead time during transfer $t_{d}$ must be small enough such that the loss is insignificant to the statistics — as photon TTL pulses will be missed during that period. If the DPU processes data in real time, the time for computation $t_{c} \u0026lt; TTL-gt$. And practically $t_{c} \u0026laquo; TTL-gt$ Autocorrelation Theory Mean Photon Statistics We can formulate Intensity $I$ as the number of photons reaching the detector in unit time.\nThe mean number of detected pulses ($\\mu$) per sample time $\\Delta T = TTL-gt$ is given in terms of the Intensity $I$, quantum efficiency $p_{det}$ of the detector , which is (detected photons / arrived photons) $$ \\begin{align} \\langle n \\rangle = \\mu \u0026amp;= p I \\Delta T\\ \\langle n_{j} \\rangle = \\mu_{j} \u0026amp;= p \\int_{(j-1)\\Delta T}^{j\\Delta T}{I(t) \\space dt}\\ \\end{align} $$\nThe computation of this mean is trivial and is performed in the DPU in the so-called monitor channels. A monitor channel keeps track of the mean number of photons that arrive in a fixed gate time $TTL-gt$.\nAutocorrelation function The autocorrelation function can characterize the \u0026ldquo;memory\u0026rdquo; of a timeseries. The amplitude of the timeseries is usually randomly distributed, however, the recurrence of these fluctuations have a characteristic time scale that characterizes the memory of the system.\nMultiple definitions of the correlation functions are possible based on the factors like normalization scheme and noise corrections. We enlist the basic definitions used in our case. ==TODO: Include Pearson\u0026rsquo;s autocorrelation==\nWe first define the raw linear autocorrelation estimator: $$ G_{le}(k) = \\frac{1}{M}{\\sum_{i=1}^{M}{n_{i}n_{i-k}}} $$ Here, $M$ is the total sample size and $n_{i}$ represents photon counts which in turn represents Intensity. Hence $n_{i} \\approx I_{i}$. This estimator estimates the real autocorrelation function ($G_{n}(k)$) which assumes that $M → \\infin$, hence, $\\langle G_{le}(k) \\rangle = G_{n}(k)$.\nThe use of the raw estimator with or without normalization is restricted to cases where the whole set $n_{i}$ is available such that $n_{i-k}$ is a defined entity. Hence, this scheme is not fit for real-time acquisition and calculation.\nRestructuring in terms of real time parameters We say that for time $m$, $0 \\leq m \u0026lt; M$, the $m^{th}$ acquisition is made. Hence, at time $m$, $n_{m}$ is available and the available sample size of photon counts is also $m$.\nThe ACF Channels at any acquisition time $m$ represents the quantity : $$ Ch(k) = {\\sum_{i=0}^{m-k}{n_{i}n_{i-k}}} $$ To acquire the ACF from the correlator module, which is equivalent to acquiring the complete set of available Channels, ==a normalization must first be performed on the whole channel==.\nThis scheme yields the ==fundamental ACF== equation : $$ G(k) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{m-k}{n_{i}n_{i-k}}}{(Norm)} $$ Note the presence of the time dependent parameter $m$. It can be inferred from the above equation that for different values of the lag time $k$, the summation operations differ. For $k = 0$, $m$ sums are performed. And for $k = m - 1$, just one sum is performed. This is an artifact of the real time averaging, which is referred to as triangular averaging. Distortions that result from this triangular averaging can be estimated and can be managed. The schematic below illustrates the arrival of photon datum and its subsequent distribution to the different channels. This is due to the fact that complete $n_{i}$ series is not available for the ACF calculation and hence the relation $\\langle n_{i}n_{i-k} \\rangle = \\langle n_{i}n_{i+k} \\rangle$ cannot be used.\nFor all lags $k$, the contribution to the ACF is not equal. hence, the normalization depends on the lag value $k$. The normalization can also include the mean square photon count. Before completion of the acquisition phase, i.e. $m \u0026lt; M$, the mean must also be estimated based on the available acquisitions. Note: $m$ represents the available samples. $$ Norm = (m-k) \\langle n \\rangle_{m}^{2} $$ ==All ACF values obtained in this way i.e. for $m \u0026lt; M$ are estimates of the estimator $G_{le}(k)$ itself.==\nAfter completing the acquisition, i.e. for $m = M$, the above equations become: $$ \\begin{align} Ch(k) \u0026amp;= {\\sum_{i=0}^{M-k}{n_{i}n_{i-k}}}\\ Norm \u0026amp;= (M-k)\\langle n \\rangle^{2} \\end{align} $$ Note: for $m = M$, $\\langle n \\rangle_{m} → \\langle n \\rangle$ . The estimated mean becomes the true sample mean.\nAnother form of ACF is possible, that characterizes the fluctuations from the mean value of the intensity. This is achieved by baseline subtraction of the estimated mean at time $m$, from the acquired intensity — $\\langle n \\rangle_{m}^{2} $. $$ g(k) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{m-k}{(n_{i} - \\langle n \\rangle_{m})(n_{i-k} - \\langle n \\rangle_{m})}}{(Norm)} $$ This function is difficult to implement for real-time applications as for each acquisition, a set of subtractions involving the estimated mean $\\langle n \\rangle_{m}$ must be made. Also, since each channel contains contributions from many estimated-means, i.e. a set of $\\langle n \\rangle_{m}$ for many $m$. The error estimation is difficult.\nEstimation of mean $\\langle n \\rangle_{m}$ → The previous section mentioned the use of \u0026ldquo;monitor-channels\u0026rdquo; for estimation of mean, this section will further illustrate that concept. If the calculation of the ACF is done in real time, it is obvious that the mean count rate $\\langle n \\rangle$ is also an estimated quantity. There are two approaches for the estimation of this quantity:\nUsing \u0026ldquo;far point channels\u0026rdquo; → which uses far away ACF channels — $\\langle n_{j} n_{j-k} \\rangle$ for very large $k$.\nFor large values of $k$, the values $n_{j}$ and $n_{j-k}$ are statistically independent (autocorrelation decays over large time interval). Hence,\n$$ \\langle n_{j} n_{j-k} \\rangle \\approx \\langle n_{j} \\rangle \\langle n_{j-k} \\rangle = \\langle n_{j} \\rangle^2 \\quad; k \u0026raquo; 0 $$\nThe $\\langle n_{j} \\rangle^2$ is the asymptotic value of the autocorrelation function which is equivalent to $ACF(\\infin)$.\nUsing \u0026ldquo;monitor channels\u0026rdquo; → which uses special counters that measure the average count rate of photon detection for a fixed sample duration $\\Delta T = TTL-gt$ — $n$. $M$ is the number of samples received by the DPU from the counter. $$ n_{e} = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{j=1}^{m}{n_{j}} $$\n→ My notes:\n• It is unclear how the far-away channels can be used when the far-away channels are not even populated — during the initial phase of the acquisition in real-time mode.\n• Computation of mean using monitor channels can be implemented trivially as follows:\nMoved to : Repo/src/monitor_channel.hpp Linear Correlator - Software Interface Linear Correlator refers to an implementation of the correlation function that uses linear scale for lag values. It is the basic auto-correlation function discussed in the previous sections.\nWith collection of $M$ samples — each sample collected over time interval $TTL-gt$, a linear estimator of the correlation function is possible (discussed in previous setions): $$ G_{le}(k) = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{j=1}^{M}{n_{j}n_{j-k}} $$\nNote from Multi-tau thesis (Yi Lui):[^TODO: Remove and add to a relavent section]\n\u0026ldquo;However, at small lag times, $M$ has almost always to be a very large number ($10^6$ or more) in order to obtain sufficient averaging over photon counting noise.\u0026rdquo;\nsequenceDiagram Photon Data -\u003e\u003e Monitor Channel : Send Photon Data -\u003e\u003e Correlation Channel : Send \u0026 Compute Monitor Channel --\u003e\u003e Normalised ACF: Compute Correlation Channel --\u003e\u003e Normalised ACF : Compute Schematics for Base Lin_ACorr Interface (line_core_base.hpp) Schematics for a linear correlator.\n→ The implementation of a linear correlator in code is implemented as class Lin_ACorr_Base. This object defines methods for any linear correlator that we want to design in code. The object class fulfills the following objectives:\nThe real-time implementations will contain an array Channel_array of size Channel_size that stores the computed ACF values at different lag times.

This tracking of the available indices must be done in order to compute the various quantities.\nAuxiliary functions to output the channels to different streams with appropriate normalization.\n→ The Linear_ACorr_Base is inherited by the following objects to give different types of linear autocorrelators:\nLinCorr_RT - Real-time AC with no baseline subtraction and no normalization. ==• Implementation Pending ↓== LinCorr_RT_Baseline - Real-time LC with baseline subtraction but no normalization.` LinCorr_RT_BaselineNorm - Real time LC with baseline subtraction and also performs normalization using calculated mean.` LinCorr_RT_Norm - Real time LC with no baseline subtraction but performs normalization using calculated mean. Logarithmic Correlator Logarithmic correlator uses a lag times that are logarithmically scaled. This method allows calculation over large times with a relatively small number of Correlator channels.\nHowever, this scheme leads to correlation channels with very small sampling time and some channels with very large sample times (the extreme channels at both ends). This leads to distortion of the ACF which is an extreme triangular distortion.\nThis distortion can be kept under check by using lag times considerably larger than the total sample time: $k_{max} \\Delta T_{k} \u0026laquo; \\sum{M \\Delta T} $.$\\ref{(Schatzel1988)}$[^Citation Pending]\nThe scaling of the lag time is given by:\n==The implementation of this schematics is pending.==\nMulti - Tau Correlator Multi-tau correlators utilize a group $S$ of linear correlators.\nHence, a multi-tau correlator object can be thought of as a block of $S$ linear correlators with a wrapper that contains functions that simultaneously update every one of the $S$ Linear Correlators in its scope.

ISR Fast Interrupt Request An interrupt request made to the microcontroller of the ARM architecture that has the highest priority among the interrupts. It is executed the fastest. FIQ Reserved Timer List List of timers that are required for operation of Arduino library functions. The goal of the implementation should be to reduce the size of this list to zero by slowly eliminating the use of Arduino library functions. [^Other advantage of this would be speed gain.] ResTL Basics of Counters/Timers A timer is a counter with a clock input. A timer uses a regular and periodic pulsing source (a clock) to count up/down to a precise time duration. The precision of the timer, thus, depends completely on the precision of the input clock. Clock selection can be done using the CCM (Clock Controller Module).\nThe timer modules share some general characteristics and functions:1\nA timer can be turned on — enabled by setting the Timer/Counter Control Register (TCCR) or simply Control Registers (CR). A timer can similarly be turned off by setting the appropriate bits in the TCCR, also if the timer supports multiple modes of operations, these are controlled by the TCCR as well. The count value of the counter is maintained in the Timer Count (TCNT) register. The initialization of TCNT, which is set after every complete cycle of the counter is done by the value stored in the Load Value (LDVAL) register. The Input Capture Register (ICR) holds the value of the counter from the last capture event. The Output Capture Register (OCR) holds the value that generates a \u0026ldquo;compare event\u0026rdquo;, usually an interrupt, when the counter reaches a certain set value. Prescalar Registers (PRs) sets the appropriate prescale value to the input clock of the counter. Usually prescalars of 8, 16, 256, etc are available with a counter module. If the counter/timer is used as a timer, and an input clock is provided. The selection of the input clock is done by the CLKSRC Clock Source Registers. If this feature is unavailable, the clock selection is handled by the CCM. The multiple IFQ interrupts for compare, capture, rollover, etc. can be enabled using the Interrupt Registers (IR). Flags for overflow, rollover, compare, and capture events are stored in the Status Registers(SR) . Other Flag registers hold the flags that are set by the different interrupt events. These flags can be read, or they internally control the triggering of ISRs. Manual clearing of flags has to be done in some cases for a reset of the timer module. Capture Event A capture event triggers a read of the current value in the count registers (TCNT) and a write to Input Capture Registers (ICR). The value can then be read from the ICR to the software memory. This function can be used to count arrival events during a fixed gated interval. This requires a trigger pulse to a particular capture pin of the timer.\n(Source: Manual)\nEach Input Capture Channel has a dedicated capture pin, capture register and input edge detection/selection logic. Each input capture function has an associated status flag, and can cause the processor to make an interrupt service request. (For GPT)\nReset Event A reset event is performed after one cycle of the timer/counter has elapsed. The resetting of the module for the next cycle involves setting of some control register bits and clearing of event flags. Some timers support auto-reset modes that will do the complete procedure.\nPeriodic Timing The first step is to fix the gating interval for the timer. Since, for an n-bit timer, the range is $2^{n} - 1$, exact timing operations can be set by setting a preload value in the LDVAL register. Hence the counting starts from a constant $a$ in the LDVAL.\nIf the input clock has a frequency $f$ , and a prescalar $p$, the timer\u0026rsquo;s counter increments by one for every: $$ \\begin{align} t_{inc} \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{f} * p = Period_{tick}\\ t_{instantaneous} \u0026amp;= a + \\Big( \\frac{1}{f} * p \\Big) * ticks\\ \\end{align} $$ Say we need the timer to generate an event after each overflow, hence, a downcounting timer must be loaded with $LDVAL = cycles -1$, $$ cycles = TTL-gt / Period_{tick} $$\nBuilding a Counter Routine[^Obsolete] The schematic above outlines the basic proposed structure of the counting module. Whereas the calculation of the autocorrelation function is discussed in the above sections.\nThe counting module consists:\nA TTL counter (TTL-t) that receives the TTL pulses and counts them. This counter must be capable of storing counts that is comparable to the usual count rate in the experiment. Apart from that the counter must have a capture mechanism and a fast reset mechanism. The choice of this counter depends on the latency of these functions.\nThe range of an n-bit counter is given by: $2^{n} - 1 $. Hence a 16-bit counter has a range of 0-65,535 ($10^{4}$) and a 32-bit counter has a range of 0 - 4,294,967,295 ($~ 10^9$). Any 32-bit timer would have enough range to accommodate for any physically possible count rates. The range of a 16-bit timers (if forced to used - because of economy) can be doubled by checking the overflow flag. Timers set an overflow flag when they exceed their maximum value during counting, reset to zero and start counting again. Use of this method requires an additional operation of resetting the overflow flag during the next cycle of operation. This mechanism is already demonstrated in the lower half of the schematics.\nTaking into account the average count rates encountered during a typical single-molecule experiments (say $10^{4}-10^{6}$ cps for FCS), we can further evaluate the problem of overflows. The typical gating time is assumed to be 100 $\\mu s$. Hence, the maximum count value during a single gate interval is $\\approx 1-10^{2}$. It is clear that 16-bit timers are also well equipped in terms of the range. Hence, the selection would entirely depend on speed of operations and access and not on the size of the counters, however, 32-bit timers would be preffered.\nThe Service Time of an ISR is the time taken to complete the ISR prescribed for a timer. Since, in our case, the ISR will interact with the TTL-t, the performance will also depend heavily on the Service Time of the ISR.\nAn Periodic-interrupt timer (PI-t ) will be used to trigger the opening and closing of a Counter Interval (TTL-gt) on the TTl-t. The selection of the timer will depend on the Interrupt Latency of the timer.\nThe Interrupt Latency is the time between the raising of the interrupt by the timer module and the execution of the first instruction of the ISR. This delay is partly natural (context saving and switching, and a goto/jump instruction) and partly implementation dependent. The implementation dependent part is significant when multiple interrupts exist in the system within a priority hierarchy. It should also be noted that while one interrupt is running, all interrupts are disabled (The ISR is blocked within two function calls - sei() and cli()2). Hence, a running interrupt may readily block the timer interrupt from executing. ==(It is however unclear to me if the wiring is done in such a way that the interrupts are handled without the use of cpu, however, the value during the capture is copied in the main memory. - EDIT: DMA operations)== For this reason, to ensure reliability, only one interrupt must be used within the system, which will be used to control the TTL-C. The ISR_CI(), say, will take the following form:\nvoid ISR_CI() { //Capture Signal to TTL-C digitalWriteFast(TTLtCapturePin, HIGH); lowest_delay(); digitalWriteFast(TTLtCapturePin, LOW); //Or an equivalent \u0026#34;Active Low Pulse\u0026#34; //DMA trigger from Input Capture register of TTL-C to software memory //Reset-Event on the TTL-C } The precise timing of the periodic interrupt service is done using an onboard clock, usually a Real-time clock (RTC), Teensy 4.1 contains a 24MHz oscillator that can be used to keep track of \u0026ldquo;real time\u0026rdquo;. Otherwise, the Peripheral bus clock can be selected which operates at $f_{CPU}/4$.\nRationale : Using PIT for PI-t Its use with DMA channels is well defined and is a common use case.\n• The DMAMUX has a special mode for using this timer.\n(Source: Manual, Page 77)\n\u0026ldquo;→ Periodic Trigger mode :\nIn this mode, a DMA source may only request a DMA transfer, such as when a transmit buffer becomes empty or a receive buffer becomes full, periodically. Configuration of the period is done in the registers of the periodic interrupt timer (PIT). This mode is available only for channels 0 to 3.\u0026rdquo;\n• Also, quoting from the description of the PIT timers (Features in page 2972):\n• Read Page 78 onwards, section 5.4.1 for details.\nThe timer is optimized for delivering periodic pulses.\nThis timer module has four 32-bit channels and hence offers good resolution.\nThe bi-modality {Stop and Run} - which is also a lack of functionality, means that the timer can be reset very fast and is ideal for our use case.\nThe clock source can be selected as the 150 MHz Peripheral Clock, which gives a resolution (timeperiod) of about 6.67 nanoseconds.\nCons: Module does not have a prescalar. However, for our use case, we can do without a prescalar and 2 PIT channels can be chained together for a similar arrangement.\nThe abbreviations might change for the different timer modules, however, the concepts are the same. Also, the abbreviations will be easy to understand after grasping the ones mentioned above.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nArduino.h defines: #define interrupts() sei() ; #define noInterrupts() cli()\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://yatharthb97.github.io/projects/correlator-card-notes/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"correlator-theory-version-1\"\u003eCorrelator Theory [version 1]\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center\"\u003eby Yatharth Bhasin\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis article introduces and explains the implementation of Correlation modules that can read a time series and compute the \u003cem\u003eautocorrelation function\u003c/em\u003e for the said time series.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe autocorrelation calculation is done for a set of \u003cem\u003elag time values\u003c/em\u003e, this set is also referred to as the \u003cem\u003eChannels\u003c/em\u003e of the Correlator module.

While C++ has a mechanism through STL chrono, such a functionality is absent in python (as per my information).\nLibrary: GitHub Gist.\nWhat is a time-literal? Just to be clear, time literal here means anything of this form : 5ns, 4min, 15.5ms. It is a numeric value (float) followed by alphabetic constants that indicate special treatment of the alpha-numeric string constant. It is similar to the use of b while declaring bytes or using x while defining a hexadecimal integer:\nbinary = 0b10000 hexadecimal = 0x12f Since python does not natively support time-literals, it can be implemented by using python strings. Here is my attempt to do the same, and while we are at it, implement some additional features as well.\nHere is a rundown of the library: A value_pair is an entity of the following form: [float, TmLiteral]. The container should be a list. The first is the absolute numeric value and the second quantity is the units, which is represented by the TmLiteral object. value_pair is fundamental to this library, since strings are parsed into value pairs. All inter-conversions also apply to value pairs. For performing such operations, the literal must first be converted into a value_pair by using the TmParser object. To verify if the given entity is a valid value-pair:\nfrom tmliteral import * IsValuePair([4.2, FindTmL(\u0026#34;seconds\u0026#34;)]) #-\u0026gt; returns True IsValuePair([4.2, \u0026#34;seconds\u0026#34;]) #-\u0026gt; returns False Print all available pre-defined literals:\nimport tmliteral.time_table for tml in tmliteral.time_table: print(tml.abbr, \u0026#39; : \u0026#39;, tml) Output:\nxxx : invalid time value s : second Ys : yottasecond Zs : zettasecond Es : exasecond Ps : petasecond Ts : terasecond Gs : gigasecond Ms : megasecond ks : kilosecond hs : hectosecond das : decasecond ds : decisecond cs : centisecond ms : millisecond us : microsecond ns : nanosecond ps : picosecond fs : femtosecond as : attosecond zs : zeptosecond ys : yoctosecond min : minute h : hour d : day week : week year : calender year leapyear : calender leap year gregyear : gregorian calendar year julianyear : julian astronomical year Create a user defined literal or find a pre-defined literal:\n# Simulation unit which is equivalent to microseconds. sim_time = TmL(\u0026#34;sim\u0026#34;, -6, simulation unit) # TmL(abbr, exp, name, mul_factor=1.0) # Get a pre-defined time unit ms = FindTmL(\u0026#34;ms\u0026#34;) also_ms = FindTmL(\u0026#34;millisecond\u0026#34;) Parsing time literals from strings can be done by creating a parser object:\nparser = TmParser() parser.add_literal(sim_time) tm1 = parser.parse(\u0026#34;4.2fs\u0026#34;) # Out→ [4.2, \u0026lt; TmLiteral : femtosecond \u0026gt;] tm2 = parser[\u0026#34;4.2fs\u0026#34;] # Same tm_sim = parser[\u0026#34;5 sim\u0026#34;] # Out→ [5.0, \u0026lt; TmLiteral : simulation time \u0026gt;] Conversions between units (casting) can be handled by creating a cast object:\nns_cast = TmCast.Find(\u0026#34;ns\u0026#34;) # Make a nano-second cast time = parser[\u0026#34;5 ms\u0026#34;] ns_time = ns_cast.cast(time) # Returns 5000 ns_time2 = ns_cast[tm2] # Equivalent to `cast` member function. Using the TmAutoScale object, appropriate units can be selected automatically. The option tmparser in the initializer can be used to pass a custom TmParser object. The auto-scale object inherits the literal order of the parser object in the \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; mode. If this option is not specified, the auto-scaler constructs a new generic TmParser object.\nThis module is extremely useful with timing of processes and converts arbitrary time values in seconds (or nanoseconds) to more \u0026ldquo;human readable\u0026rdquo; units. The object can be constructed in a variety of mode:\n\u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; : Does not modify the preference of literals which is inherited from a parser object. prefer_clock_units\u0026quot; : Prefers clock units over SI. clock units are [\u0026ldquo;second\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;minute\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;hour\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;day\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;week\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;calender year\u0026rdquo;] \u0026ldquo;prefer_SI_units\u0026rdquo; : Prefers SI units over clock units. \u0026ldquo;clock\u0026rdquo; : Only uses clock units \u0026ldquo;SI\u0026rdquo; : Only uses SI units \u0026ldquo;extended_process_timing\u0026rdquo; : Uses [\u0026ldquo;nanoseconds\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;microseconds\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;milliseconds\u0026rdquo;] + clock units. This is useful for timing of processes which requires \u0026ldquo;human-comprehensible units\u0026rdquo; on a power scale. tauto = TmAutoScale(mode=\u0026#34;prefer_clock_units\u0026#34;) tauto.scale(parser[\u0026#34;4e5 picoseconds\u0026#34;], set_scale=100) #-\u0026gt;[399.99999999999994, \u0026lt; TmLiteral : nanosecond \u0026gt;] tauto2 = TmAutoScale(mode=\u0026#34;prefer_clock_units\u0026#34;) tauto2[\u0026#34;5e7 seconds\u0026#34;] #-\u0026gt; [1.5854895991882294, \u0026lt; TmLiteral : calender year \u0026gt;] tauto2[\u0026#34;5e4 seconds\u0026#34;] #-\u0026gt;[0.5787037037037037, \u0026lt; TmLiteral : day \u0026gt;] To print a value_pair properly the function TmFormat can be used:\ntime1 = parser[\u0026#34;5 ms\u0026#34;] time2 = parser[\u0026#34;1 ns\u0026#34;] print(TmFormat(time1, format=\u0026#34;full\u0026#34;)) #-\u0026gt; 5.0 milliseconds print(TmFormat(time1, format=\u0026#34;abbr\u0026#34;)) #-\u0026gt; 5.0 ms print(TmFormat(time2, format=\u0026#34;full\u0026#34;)) #-\u0026gt; 1.0 nanosecond print(TmFormat(time2, format=\u0026#34;abbr\u0026#34;)) #-\u0026gt; 1.0 ns Now my favorite feature: the Expression Parser can perform arithmetic operations on time values that have any arbitrary units. Operations that are currently supported : {+, - , *, /, %}.\nexp = TmExpParser() print(exp.parse(\u0026#34;10ms + 5ns + 10ms\u0026#34;)) #-\u0026gt; [0.020000005, \u0026lt; TmLiteral : second \u0026gt;] I did not have a use-case in mind for this feature. But I am sure that somebody else can. Just did this for fun.\nI hope you find this library useful!
