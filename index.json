[{"content":"Transcription Networks - Basic Concepts The cell continuously monitors its environment and calculates the amount of each protein that is needed. The rate of production is controlled by transcription networks.\nTo represent environmental states, cells use special proteins called transcription factors as symbols. Transcription factors are molecules that can rapidly switch between active and inactive molecular states, with rates determined by environmental factors. Transcription factors bind to DNA and regulate read-rate of genes. Transcription factors regulate their target genes to mobilize the appropriate protein response in each case. flowchart LR genes --transcribed--\u003e mRNA --translated--\u003e proteins; proteins--modify--\u003eenvironment; environment --what?--\u003e genes E. coli: has an internal representation of about 300 degrees of freedom. Hence, it has 300 transcription factors.\nTranscription Network Model Gene: a stretch of DNA whose sequence encodes the information needed for production of a protein. Transcription: Gene is copied into a disposable mRNA molecule by RNA polymerase (RNAp). Promoter: The number of mRNA produced per unit time is controlled by a regulatory region of DNA that precedes the gene which is called promoter. It regulates the chemical affinity of the DNA to mRNA (opposite is a Repressor). Transcription factors can act as both: activators and repressors. Transcription factor proteins are themselves regulated by other transcription factors. flowchart LR; Gene-- copied by RNAp into --\u003e mRNA .- transcription; mRNA -- translated to --\u003e Protein .- translation; Representation of Network Nodes \u0026amp; Edges x → Y : Product of genes X is a promoter for the transcription of gene Y. X ⟞ Y : Product of genes X is a repressor for the transcription of gene Y. Mechanism of Transcription Networks The input of transcription factor network are signals. Each signal is a small molecule, protein modification or molecular partner that directly affects the activity of one of the transcription factors.\nThe signal usually causes physical changes in the shape of the TF protein - active molecular state.\nMajority of the proteins are not transcription factors, rather they are building blocks or catalysts.\nSeparation of Timescales:\nProcess Timescale Input Signal changes Transcription Factor ~msec Binding of active Transcription Factor to DNA equilibration ~sec Transcription and Translation of the target genes ~minutes Accumulation of the Protein Product ~hours Hence, when considering network dynamics of protein levels, the transcription factor activity levels can be considered to be in steady state.\nTranscription networks are extremely modular in nature. (GFP from jellyfish) is widely used in experiments. Promoter of effect A + Gene of effect B → mechanism that causes a when B is true. Promoters and genes are generally interchangeable. This fact also means that these networks can evolve rapidly.\nThe arrows in the transcription network evolve on a much faster timescale than the coding regions of the genes (time scale of many generations).\nEach transcription factor acts primarily in one mode for its target genes, as either an activator or repressor. However, the input mode of regulation [of a gene] is often mixed.\nInput Functions The strength of the effect of a transcription factor on a target gene is escribed by an input function.\nX regulates Y : the number of molecules of protein Y produced per unit time is a function of the concentration of X in its active form $X^{*}$.\nRate of production $Y = f(X^*)$.\nA useful function that realistically describes many gene input functions is called the Hill function. $$ f(X^*) = \\beta\\frac{X^{*n}}{\\Kappa^{n} + X^{*n}} $$\nK : activation coefficient, which has units of concentration. It defines the concentration of active X needed to significantly activate expression.\n$X^* = K$ : half-maximal expression.\n$K$ is mainly determined by the chemical affinity between $X$ and its binding site on the promoter.\n$\\beta$ : maximal promoter activity. It is reached when $X^* \\gg K$.\nThe Hill Coefficient $n$ determines the steepness of the input function. For larger n, the function is more step-like.\nUsually, input functions are moderately steep: n=1-4.\nFor a repressor, the hill function is a decreasing function.\nHence, each arrow in the network can be thought to carry at least three numbers: $\\beta, K, n$. These numbers can be readily tuned during evolution.\n$K$ : Can be varied if the position of the binding site is changed. $\\beta$ : can be tuned by the mutations in the RNAp binding site. Laboratory evolution experiments show that when placed in a new environment, bacteria can accurately tune these numbers within several hundred generations to reach optimal expression levels. Thus, these numbers are under selection pressure and can heritably change over many generations if environments change.\nMany genes have a nonzero minimal expression level, called the gene\u0026rsquo;s basal expression level. It can be described by adding a $\\beta_0$ term.\nThe essence of the input functio n is a transition between low and high values, with a characteristic threshold $K$.\nWe can hence approximate the input function with a logic approximation. It can be expressed as : $f(X^{ * }) = \\beta\\theta(X^{ * }\u0026gt; K)$. It is equivalent to a Hill function with $n \\rightarrow \\infty$.\nFor a repressor: $f(X^{ * }) = \\beta \\theta(X^{ * } \u0026lt; K)$ .\nMulti-dimensional input functions:\n$f(X^{ * }, Y^{ * }) = \\beta\\theta(X^{ * } \u0026gt; K_x)\\theta(Y^{ * }\u0026gt; K_y)$ ~ X AND Y $f(X^{ * }, Y^{ * } ) = \\beta\\theta(X^{ * } \u0026gt; K_x + Y^* \u0026gt; K_y)$ ~ X OR Y SUM input function: $f(X^{ * }, Y^{ * }) = \\beta_xX^{ * }+ \\beta_yY^{ * }$. More complex functions with many inputs\u0026hellip; Dynamics \u0026amp; Response Time $$ X + S_x \\rightarrow X^{} \\ X^ \\rightarrow P_y + mRNA \\rightarrow Protein_Y $$\n$S_x$ is the activation signal for $X$. $P_y$ is a promoter of gene $Y$.\nThe concentration of a protein in a cell is regulated by two processes: degradation ($\\alpha_{deg}$) and dillution ($\\alpha_dil{}$). The total removaal rate is hence: $\\alpha = \\alpha_{dil} + \\alpha_{deg}$. This gives us the the following dynamic equation of the concentration of a protein Y: $dY/dt = \\beta + \\alpha Y$. Solving this equation yields the steady state concentration of the protein as: $Y_{st} = \\beta / \\alpha$.\nThis is however a simplified model. The regulation of protein in reality happens at every step of the production. While the protein is contructed in cohesion with the mRNA, various micro-steps have their own regulatory mechanisms.\nResponse Time The response time is a measure of speed of a dynamical process. It is the time needed to reach halfway $T_{1/2}$ between the inital and the final levels in a dynamical process. For an example, if we assume that the protein production of Y has come to a halt. Hence, $\\beta = 0$. The dynamical equation then simplifies to: $$ Y(t) = Y_{st}e^{- \\alpha t} $$ Solving the above equation yields: $$ Y(t_{response}) = Y_{st} / 2 \\newline T_{1/2} = log(2) / \\alpha $$ This leads us to the following realisations:\nRemoval rate $\\alpha$ determines the response time. Fast removal allowes for rapid changes in the concentration of the protein. The production rate $\\beta$ determines the steady state concentration, but not the respone time. Proteins with big $\\alpha$ also need large $\\beta$ to sustain their steady state rates. This might seeem completely futile, but this tradeoff can be used for rapidy changing concentration of certain proteins.

It forms by making H-bonds between Hydrogen and oxygen.\n$\\beta$-sheets form hydrogen bonds with its whole backbone.\nUsually the alpha and beta sheets are sometimes misaligned and imperfect.\nAlpha-helix\nIn the alpha-helix, the carbonyl oxygen of residue \u0026ldquo;i\u0026rdquo; forms a hydrogen bond with the amide of the residue \u0026ldquo;i+4\u0026rdquo;. There are only right handed alpha-helixes, except for a handful of exceptions. Beta-sheets\nCan be wither parallel and antiparallel. They have roughly the same binding energy. In a beta-sheet, carbonyl oxygen and amides form hydrogen bonds between the strands, i.e between amino acids far away from each other in primary sequence. Proteins can be composed of one of the two secondary structures or be mixed.\nBeyond Secondary Structures The tertiary structure, which is the three-dimensional organisation of the secondary structure elements. It is also referred to as the protein fold. Quaternary structures refers to the association of different polypeptide chains (subunits) into a multinumeric complex. Protein domains are fundamental units of tertiary structue. it forms an independnt structural domin. They are often units of function. Domains have the same fold yet different amino acid sequences. Protein domains are very stable to mutations. ANd they have been selected via evolution for the very specific reason. The stability of the folded structure results primarily from the hydrophobic regions folding in together. Two proteins with different sequences can have the same sequence. Conformations and Folding Protein conformational changes does not require breaking bonds. The peptide bond has partial double bond character and therefore are sterically hindered. Protein folding induces conformational changes in the backbone. The backbone torsion angles $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ determine that conformation of the protein chain. The Ramachandran diagram define the restrictions on backbone conformation. $\\psi$ : TODO $\\phi$ : TODO L: Left handed helix You see a lot of Glycines in loops as they are flexible because of the absence of any side chains. Prolines are in Cis conformation so they ususally \u0026ldquo;kink\u0026rdquo; the alpha-helix. Not generally found anywhere else. Secondary structural elements are conected to form simple motifs. Given motifs, you can create many folds. The interactions between the atoms in a protein control the folding of the protein into a well defined structure (native structure): Thermodynamic hyposthesis of protein folding. It was demonstrated by the famous Anfinsen Experiment which opened the folded structure of a protein and allowed it to relax in a controlled manner to recover the folded structure, This information is encoded in their amino acid sequence. Evolution and Protein Structure by Casper Goverde Reading Suggestion: The Molecules of Life (Chapter 5)\nProtein structures are conserved during evolution while amino acids vary.\nMotifs that are crutial for protein folding are conserved during evolution.\nYou can use protein globins to classify species at the molecular level.\nDue to different selection pressures amd line seperation, protein sequences diverge between species.\nHow to quantify differences in sequences? Use a substitution matrix (BLOSUM). We use a matrix of probailities. Each entry in the matrix is called a substitution score ($S_{ij}$). The higher the score (positive), the more likely is the substition.\nThe BLOSUM substitution score is the logarithm of the likelihood that one aa in a protein is replaced by another during evolution.\n$S_{ij}$ is related to the frequency of substititon over random chance.\nBLAST (Basic Local Alignmnet Search Tool) : Identify novel proteins, find functional relationships and sequence motifs and patterns.\nTOP-7 is the first synthetic motif.\nThe most used measure is the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD).\nDomains are \u0026ldquo;self contained units\u0026rdquo; that can be placed in different proteins.\nPyMol Excercises Superimposition is done by fitting the polypeptide backbone of your target protein on the reference protein.

Universality: an idea of the epistemic validity of Science Locality:c science is influences by its local conditions of production Globally: the circulation of scientific knowledge, materials, and practices from one location to other. Thomas Hunt Morgan, American was responsible for coming up with Drosophilia model systems. Morgan get the Nobel Prize for \u0026ldquo;The Mechanisms of Mendelian Heridity\u0026rdquo;. He inbred flies in the lab in a bio-reactor to amplify rare mutations. The first mutant he discovered was controlling the eye color of the fly. He also found that mutations co-occur. So you can put mutations into discrete groups based on co-occurance. Chromosomes can cross over which results in recombination of genes. Recombination rates can be used as a measure of proximity. From this methotend to kill you, its d they were able to create a linear photo-map of the genes. This gets the PI a nobel prize. This also cements the Chromosome-gene theory for genetics. Gene is the unit of Structure, Function, Recombination, and Mutation. Morgan runs a tight ship of the Boss and the Bois. Chromosomes are proteins + DNA. Its Nucleoproteins.

In mammals, Toll induces signals required for the activation of both an innate and an adaptive immune response.

While C++ has a mechanism through STL chrono, such a functionality is absent in python (as per my information).\nLibrary: GitHub Gist.\nWhat is a time-literal? Just to be clear, time literal here means anything of this form : 5ns, 4min, 15.5ms. It is a numeric value (float) followed by alphabetic constants that indicate special treatment of the alpha-numeric string constant. It is similar to the use of b while declaring bytes or using x while defining a hexadecimal integer:\nbinary = 0b10000 hexadecimal = 0x12f Since python does not natively support time-literals, it can be implemented by using python strings. Here is my attempt to do the same, and while we are at it, implement some additional features as well.\nHere is a rundown of the library: A value_pair is an entity of the following form: [float, TmLiteral]. The container should be a list. The first is the absolute numeric value and the second quantity is the units, which is represented by the TmLiteral object. value_pair is fundamental to this library, since strings are parsed into value pairs. All inter-conversions also apply to value pairs. For performing such operations, the literal must first be converted into a value_pair by using the TmParser object. To verify if the given entity is a valid value-pair:\nfrom tmliteral import * IsValuePair([4.2, FindTmL(\u0026#34;seconds\u0026#34;)]) #-\u0026gt; returns True IsValuePair([4.2, \u0026#34;seconds\u0026#34;]) #-\u0026gt; returns False Print all available pre-defined literals:\nimport tmliteral.time_table for tml in tmliteral.time_table: print(tml.abbr, \u0026#39; : \u0026#39;, tml) Output:\nxxx : invalid time value s : second Ys : yottasecond Zs : zettasecond Es : exasecond Ps : petasecond Ts : terasecond Gs : gigasecond Ms : megasecond ks : kilosecond hs : hectosecond das : decasecond ds : decisecond cs : centisecond ms : millisecond us : microsecond ns : nanosecond ps : picosecond fs : femtosecond as : attosecond zs : zeptosecond ys : yoctosecond min : minute h : hour d : day week : week year : calender year leapyear : calender leap year gregyear : gregorian calendar year julianyear : julian astronomical year Create a user defined literal or find a pre-defined literal:\n# Simulation unit which is equivalent to microseconds. sim_time = TmL(\u0026#34;sim\u0026#34;, -6, simulation unit) # TmL(abbr, exp, name, mul_factor=1.0) # Get a pre-defined time unit ms = FindTmL(\u0026#34;ms\u0026#34;) also_ms = FindTmL(\u0026#34;millisecond\u0026#34;) Parsing time literals from strings can be done by creating a parser object:\nparser = TmParser() parser.add_literal(sim_time) tm1 = parser.parse(\u0026#34;4.2fs\u0026#34;) # Out→ [4.2, \u0026lt; TmLiteral : femtosecond \u0026gt;] tm2 = parser[\u0026#34;4.2fs\u0026#34;] # Same tm_sim = parser[\u0026#34;5 sim\u0026#34;] # Out→ [5.0, \u0026lt; TmLiteral : simulation time \u0026gt;] Conversions between units (casting) can be handled by creating a cast object:\nns_cast = TmCast.Find(\u0026#34;ns\u0026#34;) # Make a nano-second cast time = parser[\u0026#34;5 ms\u0026#34;] ns_time = ns_cast.cast(time) # Returns 5000 ns_time2 = ns_cast[tm2] # Equivalent to `cast` member function. Using the TmAutoScale object, appropriate units can be selected automatically. The option tmparser in the initializer can be used to pass a custom TmParser object. The auto-scale object inherits the literal order of the parser object in the \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; mode. If this option is not specified, the auto-scaler constructs a new generic TmParser object.\nThis module is extremely useful with timing of processes and converts arbitrary time values in seconds (or nanoseconds) to more \u0026ldquo;human readable\u0026rdquo; units. The object can be constructed in a variety of mode:\n\u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; : Does not modify the preference of literals which is inherited from a parser object. prefer_clock_units\u0026quot; : Prefers clock units over SI. clock units are [\u0026ldquo;second\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;minute\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;hour\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;day\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;week\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;calender year\u0026rdquo;] \u0026ldquo;prefer_SI_units\u0026rdquo; : Prefers SI units over clock units. \u0026ldquo;clock\u0026rdquo; : Only uses clock units \u0026ldquo;SI\u0026rdquo; : Only uses SI units \u0026ldquo;extended_process_timing\u0026rdquo; : Uses [\u0026ldquo;nanoseconds\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;microseconds\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;milliseconds\u0026rdquo;] + clock units. This is useful for timing of processes which requires \u0026ldquo;human-comprehensible units\u0026rdquo; on a power scale. tauto = TmAutoScale(mode=\u0026#34;prefer_clock_units\u0026#34;) tauto.scale(parser[\u0026#34;4e5 picoseconds\u0026#34;], set_scale=100) #-\u0026gt;[399.99999999999994, \u0026lt; TmLiteral : nanosecond \u0026gt;] tauto2 = TmAutoScale(mode=\u0026#34;prefer_clock_units\u0026#34;) tauto2[\u0026#34;5e7 seconds\u0026#34;] #-\u0026gt; [1.5854895991882294, \u0026lt; TmLiteral : calender year \u0026gt;] tauto2[\u0026#34;5e4 seconds\u0026#34;] #-\u0026gt;[0.5787037037037037, \u0026lt; TmLiteral : day \u0026gt;] To print a value_pair properly the function TmFormat can be used:\ntime1 = parser[\u0026#34;5 ms\u0026#34;] time2 = parser[\u0026#34;1 ns\u0026#34;] print(TmFormat(time1, format=\u0026#34;full\u0026#34;)) #-\u0026gt; 5.0 milliseconds print(TmFormat(time1, format=\u0026#34;abbr\u0026#34;)) #-\u0026gt; 5.0 ms print(TmFormat(time2, format=\u0026#34;full\u0026#34;)) #-\u0026gt; 1.0 nanosecond print(TmFormat(time2, format=\u0026#34;abbr\u0026#34;)) #-\u0026gt; 1.0 ns Now my favorite feature: the Expression Parser can perform arithmetic operations on time values that have any arbitrary units. Operations that are currently supported : {+, - , *, /, %}.\nexp = TmExpParser() print(exp.parse(\u0026#34;10ms + 5ns + 10ms\u0026#34;)) #-\u0026gt; [0.020000005, \u0026lt; TmLiteral : second \u0026gt;] I did not have a use-case in mind for this feature. But I am sure that somebody else can. Just did this for fun.\nI hope you find this library useful!
