+ Phenotypic space describe one or more phenotypic space of an organism.  It is a space defined by a vector $v$, where $v$ is a set of described traits.
+ The space of all phenotypes is called the morphospace. (U. Alon 2012)
+ The best optimization of a trait gives a single optimality point in the morphospace.
