# Introduction

### Equilibrium Phase

* It is characterized by well defined values of thermodynamic variables → {T, P, V, Stress, etc}
* If the phase is ordered, the **order parameter** must be added to the list.
* For exploring the phase-space, a **control variable** is changed, while the other variables respond to the change.
* When the control variable / parameter becomes sufficiently large, the system leaves the **Equilibrium branch**.



### Non-equilibrium Phase

![Non-equilibrium branching](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yasar-Demirel/publication/221984753/figure/fig1/AS:393945017274376@1470935219170/Thermodynamic-branch-48-showing-the-properties-of-physical-and-biological-systems-away.png)

* The initial part of the curve which grows from the state of thermodynamic equilibrium is referred to as the **thermodynamic branch.**

### Phase Transitions







### Pattern Formations

* The case study of convection currents is particularly interesting. Far from equilibrium, convection currents can become ordered, leading to geometric patterns - **Spatial patterns**.
* Some chemical mixtures exhibit ordered changing of colors. Laser is an array of light sources that emit at a particular fixed frequency (while being out of equilibrium). This is an example of **temporal patterning**.
* Other complex cases may exhibit **spacio-temporal patterns** . A special kind of chemical reactions called *rotating chemical reactions* show this. See [Chemical Oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_oscillator).

* The solution of the equation of the system corresponding to the thermodynamic branch will have the same symmetry corresponding to the parent equation. But the solution selected after the bifurcation will usually have lesser symmetry.

### Life

**Erwin Schrodinger**: "Living matter evades decay to equilibrium."

Which means: A living object is in a state that is far from equilibrium. If a living object attains thermodynamic equilibrium, then it is dead. **This gives us a new definition of death — a physicist's definition.**

Oparin's rules for a living system:

1. It must exhibit metabolism. Ingest, digest, absorb, and eject. 

2. The system must be able to reproduce.
3. It must be capable of undergoing mutation. **[?]**

### Summary

* Systems driven far from equilibrium seek new stable states.
* These systems usually have spacial and temporal ordering.
* The jump to these special states can be viewed as **nonequilibrium phase transition**.
* These transitions can be analyzed by setting up a suitable equation and soling it.
* The ordering present in the new state can be analysed in terms of symmetry breaking. **[?]**

* The origin of life (in the prebiotic soup) could be viewed as a non-equilibrium phase trnasition associated with complex chemical reactions amongst the constituent molecules in the soup, and leading to a super molecule which behaved as if it had life.
