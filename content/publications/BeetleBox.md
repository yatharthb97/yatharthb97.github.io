<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="https://medium.com/beetlebox/the-romanticism-of-the-nib-d82a435df5cc">The Romanticism of the Nib</a></h4><p>The archetype of the lover is the most intriguing and the most diverse. Lovers have loved and hated, killed or have been killed, love affairs have shaken the very seat of god and burned alive cities. Great lovers have crafted poems and written love letters. Some have drafted eulogies.</p></blockquote>
