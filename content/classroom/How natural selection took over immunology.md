# How natural selection took over immunology

+ > Read: Clonal selection theory.

+ If an organism is infected, it produces antibodies.

+ The body has antibodies for even artificial synthestic novel foreign bodies when injected.

+ Antigens + Antibody results in a precipitation reaction.

+ > Electrophorosis of Serum Globulin, Sanger Sequencing. 

+  Ultra-centrifugation of antibody precipitation to differentiate IGG and IGM.

+ Criticisms of the Pauling approach where the Globulin changes conformation and wraps around the threat fails to explain the exponential growth observed in the concentration of antibodies over time.

+ Skin grafting was a hot field after war. The rejection of foreign tissue was well known. If the same person is given the same tissue a second time it rejects is faster. This indicated an immuological response.

+ If in embroyonic life, foreign cells are introduced, then the body develops no immunological response to it. This is not entirely true, as only some particular type of tissues work this way.

+ Self-on-self-discrimination: the immune system discriminates between the tissues of its own body vs foreign objects.

# Drosophilia and Beyond: Experimental Systems in Genetics

<center> by Michael Dietrich </center>

+ The designation of the "model organis1m" was given to a set of organisms by the Human Genome Project in 1990.
+ How did the fly become such a dominant model organism in research?
+ Science is produced locally, but it transmits globally.
+ Universality: an idea of the epistemic validity of Science
+ Locality:c science is influences by its local conditions of production
+ Globally: the circulation of scientific knowledge, materials, and practices from one location to other.
+ Thomas Hunt Morgan, American was responsible for coming up with Drosophilia model systems.
+ Morgan get the Nobel Prize for "The Mechanisms of Mendelian Heridity".
+ He inbred flies in the lab in a bio-reactor to amplify rare mutations.
+ The first mutant he discovered was controlling the eye color of the fly.
+ He also found that **mutations co-occur**. So you can put mutations into discrete groups based on co-occurance.
+ Chromosomes can cross over which results in recombination of genes.
+ Recombination rates can be used as a measure of proximity. From this methotend to kill you, its d they were able to create a linear photo-map of the genes. This gets the PI a nobel prize.
+ This also cements the Chromosome-gene theory for genetics.
+ Gene is the unit of Structure, Function, Recombination, and Mutation.
+ Morgan runs a tight ship of the Boss and the Bois.
+ Chromosomes are proteins + DNA. Its Nucleoproteins.
+ H.J. muller invents the Balanced Lethal Assay. He was able to show that their is a linear relationship between X-ray dosage and the amount of mutations. He got the nobel prize for this.

### Mammalian Genetics

+ "Got a weird mouse? Kill it and ship it to Harvard!"

+ The process and hence the research is much slower.

+ Seawell Wright works extensively on Gunnie pigs.

+ Because mutations in development tend to kill you, they are difficult to detect.

+ Mammal and maize geneticists were interested in variable phenotypes.

+ The variability of phenotypes and their mixtures can be explained by bringing time into picture. It is the **temporal dependece of certain genes**.

## Conclusions

+ The locus of univerality in Biology is the genetic code. Nothing else is universal in any way. Organisms evolve over time in complex ways to produce very distinct organismic systems.
