# Introduction

+ **Ernest Haeckel (1866):** The study of the home life of organisms.
+ **Charles Krebs (1972):** The scientific study of interactions that determine the distribution and abundance of organisms.



# On the inequality of species

<center>Jérôme Chave</center>

+ What do we conserve? ...the abundant, the pretty, or the rare?
+ Bird Count website: https://birdcount.in/ .
+ We can measure relative trends between the different birds species. But how can we measure a composite trends in abundance?



## Global Living Planet Index

+ 1979: Index value = 1.
+ By 2016, there has been a 68% reduction in the index value.
+ The LPI quantifies the change in numbers of individuals in a seleted subset of animal populations.
+ The LPI includes 20,811 populations and 4,392 species.

Trends:

+ About half of the population sizes are increasing, the other half are decreasing.
+ However thise populations that are decreasing are decreasing faster.



## Elinor Ostrom's Theory

+ Beyond the individualism/communism opposition, real-life social system.

## Neutral Theory

+ > RA Fisher's paper on the power law for distribution of species.

+ In statistics, it is assumed that all the species 'behave' similarly.



## Ecology and Conservation of Cetaceans

<center>Inês Carvalho</center>

+ Cetaceans: Marine animals, big, whales, dolphins, etc.
+ The size of Cetacea is 92 species.
+ Oxygen: They use their stored supply of oxygen for breathing below water. In these family, breathing is a concious so the animal is always awake. They decide when and if they should breathe.
+ Data recorded to study them:
  + Photo-identification
  + Filming (surface, underwater, aerial)
  + Acoustic register
  + Tags - recording devices (TDR; satellite, crittercam)
+ Remote sampling - Biological samples - using a crossbow and sometimes drones:
  + Genetics/Genomics
  + Chemicals (Contaminants, stable isotopes, hormones)
  + Biological (microbes and bacteria, prey)
+ The data provides information about:
  + Individual and sex determination
  + Genetic diversity
  + Population structure
  + ...TODO
+ Bottlenose dolphin is one of the most common species in mainland Portugal - is estimated ~6500 individuals on our coast.





# Metabolic ecology — how we can use metabolism to study the functioning of biological communities

<center>Giulia Ghedini</center>

+ Metabolic Thoery of Ecology (Brown et al. 2004).
+ Use chemostats for analysis.
+ DAPI binds to DNA, and can be used to distinguish dead cells. As it only enters the cells when the cell wall is damaged.



## Summary

+ Species interactions alter how organisms use energy.
+ Density-dependent energy use can drive patterns at larger scales.
+ Populations and communities are not simply the sum of their parts.
