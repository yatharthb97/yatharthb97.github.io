+ Write a project abstract : Pick up something you heared this week. Think about a project and write a "grant proposal" kind of thing. Send the final version by Monday. **[deadline]**



# Introduction to the Cell Cycle

<center> Raquel Oliveira </center>





+ the DNA molecule: Long-term storage of information
  + reading
  + transmission
+ The human **karyotype**: 23 chromosome pairs
+ During cell division, you seperate the chromatins, not the chromosomes.
+ The human body experiences ~10, 000 trillion cell divisions during the lifetime.
+ Why do cells divide?
  + Reproduction: the only time when the chromosome pairs reseperate
  + Regeneration: Starfishes are really good at it, Human liver can regenerate from its $1/3^{rd}$ proportion.
  + Cell Rejuvination
+ ![The cell cycle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/General_cell_cycle.jpg)
+ Most cells are usually in the $G_0$ phase.
+ The "must do" of cell division:
  + replicate their DNA and organelles
  + segregate its contenet equally in the two daughter cells
  + ensure the right order of events

+ Cell mass grows linearly during the cell cycle, whereas, the DNA content looks like a step function.

+ The search for the master cell cycle regulators:
  + Biochemical approach: Cells specialized for rapid and synchronomus division (exhibiying natural blocks)
  + Genetic approach: Cells in whiuch genetic manipulations are straightforward. Cells displaying prominent control points.
  + **Eventuall, the two branches were merged.**
+ **A temperature sensitive mutant**: The mutant will die due to temperature change. Its a way of implementing **conditional muatation** in the experiment cycle.
+ **Haploid yeast**: Its easier to screen for mutants.
+ **Permissive (low) temperature**: You see all stages of the cell cycle.
+ **Restrict (high) temperature**: Cells are stuck at the $G_1$ phase.
+ Cyclin + Cdk complex are essential for cell division in frog egg. The 2001 Nobel Prize for given for the discovery of key regulators of the cell division cycle.
+ Regulators of the cell cycle:
  + **G1**: Cyclin D + Cdk 4 and Cyclin D + Cdk6
  + **S**. Cyclin E + Cdk2
  + **G2**: Cyclin A + Cdk2
  + **M**: Cyclin B + Cdk1
+ Whwn something decreases very sharply, its probaly being regulated by the degradation os something.

# DNA replication "inside a cell"

<center> Marco Fumasoni</center>





+ There are restrictions when we need cell replication inside the cell, in contrast to say a PCR:

  + Replication is done with only one cycle.

  + Under-replication / Over-replication  of the DNA can lead to misfolding of the chromatins.

    ![under Replication](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fnrc3916/MediaObjects/41568_2015_Article_BFnrc3916_Fig1_HTML.jpg)

+ In bacteria, the DNA replication is not very time controlled, hence the problem of over-replication does not hinder the development of the cell.
