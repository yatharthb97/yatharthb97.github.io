+ Write a project abstract : Pick up something you heared this week. Think about a project and write a "grant proposal" kind of thing. Send the final version by Monday. **[deadline]**



# Introduction to the Cell Cycle

<center> Raquel Oliveira </center>





+ the DNA molecule: Long-term storage of information
  + reading
  + transmission
+ The human **karyotype**: 23 chromosome pairs
+ During cell division, you seperate the chromatins, not the chromosomes.
+ The human body experiences ~10, 000 trillion cell divisions during the lifetime.
+ Why do cells divide?
  + Reproduction: the only time when the chromosome pairs reseperate
  + Regeneration: Starfishes are really good at it, Human liver can regenerate from its $1/3^{rd}$ proportion.
  + Cell Rejuvination
+ ![The cell cycle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/General_cell_cycle.jpg)
+ Most cells are usually in the $G_0$ phase.
+ The "must do" of cell division:
  + replicate their DNA and organelles
  + segregate its contenet equally in the two daughter cells
  + ensure the right order of events

+ Cell mass grows linearly during the cell cycle, whereas, the DNA content looks like a step function.

+ The search for the master cell cycle regulators:
  + Biochemical approach: Cells specialized for rapid and synchronomus division (exhibiying natural blocks)
  + Genetic approach: Cells in whiuch genetic manipulations are straightforward. Cells displaying prominent control points.
  + **Eventuall, the two branches were merged.**
+ **A temperature sensitive mutant**: The mutant will die due to temperature change. Its a way of implementing **conditional muatation** in the experiment cycle.
+ **Haploid yeast**: Its easier to screen for mutants.
+ **Permissive (low) temperature**: You see all stages of the cell cycle.
+ **Restrict (high) temperature**: Cells are stuck at the $G_1$ phase.
+ Cyclin + Cdk complex are essential for cell division in frog egg. The 2001 Nobel Prize for given for the discovery of key regulators of the cell division cycle.
+ Regulators of the cell cycle:
  + **G1**: Cyclin D + Cdk 4 and Cyclin D + Cdk6
  + **S**. Cyclin E + Cdk2
  + **G2**: Cyclin A + Cdk2
  + **M**: Cyclin B + Cdk1
+ Whwn something decreases very sharply, its probaly being regulated by the degradation os something.

# DNA replication "inside a cell"

<center> Marco Fumasoni</center>





+ There are restrictions when we need cell replication inside the cell, in contrast to say a PCR:

  + Replication is done with only one cycle.

  + Under-replication / Over-replication  of the DNA can lead to misfolding of the chromatins.

    ![under Replication](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fnrc3916/MediaObjects/41568_2015_Article_BFnrc3916_Fig1_HTML.jpg)

+ In bacteria, the DNA replication is not very time controlled, hence the problem of over-replication does not hinder the development of the cell.

+ Origin  is liciened to "**ORC"** : Origin Recognition Complex, which recognises the Helicase.

+ **Helicase**: Enzyme that unpacks the genetic material. In this context, it opens up the double Helix.

+ What makes certain Origins slower? (Some origins can fire but they don't)

+ To prevent the activation of certain Origins, the cell can use checkpoints like the regulation of DDK. mec1 modification can express DDK and r+then control the oroduction of DDK.

  

# Mitosis

+ > Riddle: Two blind man go shopping for socks 
  >
  > There was a man who went to the mall and he bought 3 pairs of red socks and 3 pairs of white socks. Another man who already bought 3 pairs of red socks and 3 pairs of white socks came back to return his 3 pairs of red socks and 3 pairs of white socks. They are both blind. As they were walking they bumped into each other. All the socks scattered around the floor, but each pair remained held together by a rubber band. Nobody helped them pick it up except each other, but in 3 minutes they both put them back altogether. Each man ended up with the same colors of socks he started with: six red and six white. How is that possible if they are blind?

+ How do cells divide? 

+ [Kangaroo-Rat from Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musky_rat-kangaroo) as our model organiosm, since it has only 12 to 13 chromosomes.

+ Insects (like the Drosophilia) divide for 13 generations in a single "Pangea cell". Hence, the division is extremenly synchronised.

### Questions

+ The constraint of space. Can't we have a bigger nucleus? So that more space allows for less crowding bias.

+  How much force does the spindles apply when they are pulling apart the chromatins?

+ How do they [the spindles] know when its the right time to pull ?

+ How do Chromosomes find their way?
