## Introduction



+ **Z distribution** is a special **normal distribution** with mean 0 and deviations 1.
+ **Quantiles** is splitting the distribution into different sizes based on probability mass.
+ **SEM (Standard Error of means)** is the same as the variance of the sample.
+ 95% of the normal distribution is within **2 $\sigma$** (standard deviations) of the mean.
+ 0.025 quanta: 
+ Median is the point of the 50% quantile.



##  Lecture 2

+ $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are usually unknown. Thats why we use Greek letters. They are for the gods to know.

+ $E(x)$ is the expected value, which is our measurement of the **mean**. For m samples:
  $$
  E(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i X_i = \sum \frac{1}{m} X_i
  $$

+ 

+ The variance is defined as:
  $$
  S^2 = E \Big(\sum_{i=1}^{m}(X_i - m)^2 \Big) = \sum \frac{1}{n-1} \Big( x_i - m \Big)^2
  $$
