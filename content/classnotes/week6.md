# General concepts in Developmental Biology and their historical context

<center>Moisés Mallo</center>

### Assignment




## Introduction



+ The change of common understanding of genetic material from proteins to DNA was a long ardious process.We will study some of these perspectives in the class.

#### Some Historical Perspective

+ **Preformation: ** 

​		![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Preformation.GIF)

+ Epigenesis: The theory of how the seed evolves into a lively being.
+ Two kinds of cells (**Theory of Germ Plasm)**:
  + Germ cells: The cells that are used for reproduction. Zygote?
  + Somatic cells: make the body. Mutations in the Somatic cells are not passed on to the next generation.

+ **Pluripotency/totipotency:**

+ **The Spemann-Mangold Experiment:**

+ The experiments at Thomas Hunt Morgan's lab used Deosophila to show the inheritance of traits that were particularly present on the genetic material of one of the parent. They could definatively claim that the genetic encoding was present on the chromosomes using their experiments.

+ **Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer:**

  ![Somatic cell nuclear transfer - Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Cloning_diagram_english.svg/1200px-Cloning_diagram_english.svg.png)

+ Genes control embryonic development: This was illustrated using the "Hox Genes", where they modified a single gene, with whose modification, they were able to indice the development of many legs in Drosophila.
+ **Zebra Fish is used as a model organism** because you can see the whole embryonic development process clearly under the microscope.

## Morphogens

A morphogen is a molecule that controls the formation of patterns during embryonic development through their non-unifrom distribution.

+ Morphogenes were identified that control the patterns during embryonic development stages.

## Induction

+ Two kinds of Induction
  + Instructive: Tissue is told what to become.
  + Permissive: Tissue knows what to become already, it wait for its trigger.



## Generic Notes

+ Stem cells can divide forever in a culture.

+ Genetic Material Transfer

# The emerging technologies and approaches applied to the study of development

<center>Moisés Mallo</center>



+ How do you know what is going on inside cells or tissues? Identification of the activity of single genes/proteins and their combination:
  + Globally: Northern blot, Western blot, RT-PCR
  + Spatial resolution: In situ hybridization, immunochemistry 

+ Western Blot: Seperates proteins based on the size of their sequences. The protein is denatured and folded with sphericity using a chemical agent before placing it in the gel.
+ Massive Paralle Sequencing: 
+ Capturing dynamic processes of cellular lineages:
  + RNA velocity
    + Compares splices and non-spliced RNA sequences
    + 
  + Diffusion maps
    + Searches for the nearest neighbor graphs in the transcriptomes of consecutive stages to create orderly sequences and branches
    + Uses data from developmental series

## Some Xenopus laevis discoveries and gossip
+ X. laevis and X. tropicalis: The development temperatures are different. For Tropicalis, it can be controlled quite well.
+ The origin of these frogs is in Africa. In the wild, they are very agressive and at many places they have become an invasive species.
+ [`Xenbase`](www.xenbase.org)  [`Xenopus`](www.xenopusresource.org) are websites that are databases for Xenopus.
+ How this started? : Luigi Galvani and the frog mustle experiment(s).
+ Electric fields drive neural crest migration ex vivo.

### The Xenopus Pregnancy Test

+ Inject frogs with urine sample while them swim in a sterile buffer. The sampl was injected near the overies of the femaile Xenopus.
+ Only effective for detection if the pregnancy was about 3-5 weeks.
+ Release of frog eggs would indicate a pregnancy.
  
  ## Down to Embroyos

+ The nucleus from the same species can be transplanted into an egg and it can develop to a tadpole and beyond.
+ 'Something' happens later when the cells get differentiated that makes the nucleus unable to be reprogrammed.
+ Later in 2012, John B. Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka got the Nobel Prize for their work in understanding 'the something' - which today is called nuclear reprogramming.
+ Robert Briggs and Thomas J King did the very first nuclar transplantation in Xenopus.

#### Spemann-Mongold organizer
+ 1924: they discovered the Spemann-Mongold organizer which is a portion of the embroyo that induces other cells to organize specifically.

## The motor of morphogenesis

+ Fate maps: put fluorophores in a particular locations and track where they end up during morphogenesis.

# Synchronising tissue morphogenesis

+ **Cell migration** involves active translocation of a cell or a group of cells from one position to another and it is essential in a wide range of physiological as well as pathological contexts.

+ Warber Effect: Hypoxy in the presence of sufficient oxygen due to excessive expenditure in active transport.
