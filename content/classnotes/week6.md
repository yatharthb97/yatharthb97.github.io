# General concepts in Developmental Biology and their historical context

### Assignment




## Introduction



+ The change of common understanding of genetic material from proteins to DNA was a long ardious process.We will study some of these perspectives in the class.

#### Some Historical Perspective

+ **Preformation: **

+ Epigenesis: The theory of how the seed evolves into a lively being.
+ Two kinds of cells (**Theory of Germ Plasm)**:
  + Germ cells: The cells that are used for reproduction. Zygote?
  + Somatic cells: make the body. Mutations in the Somatic cells are not passed on to the next generation.

+ **Pluripotency/totipotency:**

+ **The Spemann-Mangold Experiment:**

+ The experiments at Thomas Hunt Morgan's lab used Deosophila to show the inheritance of traits that were particularly present on the genetic material of one of the parent. They could definatively claim that the genetic encoding was present on the chromosomes using their experiments.

+ **Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer:**

+ Genes control embryonic development: This was illustrated using the "Hox Genes", where they modified a single gene, with whose modification, they were able to indice the development of many legs in Drosophila.
