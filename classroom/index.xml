      <description>How natural selection took over immunology by Jorge Carneiro ​
Read: Clonal selection theory.
If an organism is infected, it produces antibodies.
The body has antibodies for even artificial synthestic novel foreign bodies when injected.
Antigens + Antibody results in a precipitation reaction.
Electrophorosis of Serum Globulin, Sanger Sequencing.
Ultra-centrifugation of antibody precipitation to differentiate IGG and IGM.
Criticisms of the Pauling approach where the Globulin changes conformation and wraps around the threat fails to explain the exponential growth observed in the concentration of antibodies over time.</description>

      <description>Introduction 1 September 2022
Poluploid: $m*n$ chromosomes. Some organisms have body parts that are polydiploid. In plants the $n$ also correlates with size of the species. Excercises on SQB. Learning R Plotting is done in some application/GUI called Quartz. Arrows can change direction semantically but systematically with attributes and pointers. Read about Mendel´s laws. &amp;ldquo;Penatrance&amp;rdquo;. </description>
