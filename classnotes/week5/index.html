Think about a project and write a ‚Äúgrant proposal‚Äù kind of thing. Send the final version by Monday. [deadline] Introduction to the Cell Cycle Raquel Oliveira the DNA molecule: Long-term storage of information\nreading transmission The human karyotype: 23 chromosome pairs\nDuring cell division, you seperate the chromatins, not the chromosomes.\nThe human body experiences ~10, 000 trillion cell divisions during the lifetime.\nWhy do cells divide?\nReproduction: the only time when the chromosome pairs reseperate Regeneration: Starfishes are really good at it, Human liver can regenerate from its $1/3^{rd}$ proportion. Cell Rejuvination Most cells are usually in the $G_0$ phase.\nThe ‚Äúmust do‚Äù of cell division:\nreplicate their DNA and organelles segregate its contenet equally in the two daughter cells ensure the right order of events Cell mass grows linearly during the cell cycle, whereas, the DNA content looks like a step function.\nThe search for the master cell cycle regulators:\nBiochemical approach: Cells specialized for rapid and synchronomus division (exhibiying natural blocks) Genetic approach: Cells in whiuch genetic manipulations are straightforward. Cells displaying prominent control points. Eventuall, the two branches were merged. A temperature sensitive mutant: The mutant will die due to temperature change. Its a way of implementing conditional muatation in the experiment cycle.\nHaploid yeast: Its easier to screen for mutants.\nPermissive (low) temperature: You see all stages of the cell cycle.\nRestrict (high) temperature: Cells are stuck at the $G_1$ phase.\nCyclin + Cdk complex are essential for cell division in frog egg. The 2001 Nobel Prize for given for the discovery of key regulators of the cell division cycle.\nRegulators of the cell cycle:\nG1: Cyclin D + Cdk 4 and Cyclin D + Cdk6 S. Cyclin E + Cdk2 G2: Cyclin A + Cdk2 M: Cyclin B + Cdk1 Whwn something decreases very sharply, its probaly being regulated by the degradation os something.\nDNA replication ‚Äúinside a cell‚Äù Marco Fumasoni There are restrictions when we need cell replication inside the cell, in contrast to say a PCR:\nReplication is done with only one cycle.\nUnder-replication / Over-replication of the DNA can lead to misfolding of the chromatins.\nIn bacteria, the DNA replication is not very time controlled, hence the problem of over-replication does not hinder the development of the cell.\nOrigin is liciened to ‚ÄúORC‚Äù : Origin Recognition Complex, which recognises the Helicase.\nHelicase: Enzyme that unpacks the genetic material. In this context, it opens up the double Helix.\nWhat makes certain Origins slower? (Some origins can fire but they don‚Äôt)\nTo prevent the activation of certain Origins, the cell can use checkpoints like the regulation of DDK. mec1 modification can express DDK and r+then control the oroduction of DDK.\nMitosis Raquel Oliveira Riddle: Two blind man go shopping for socks\nThere was a man who went to the mall and he bought 3 pairs of red socks and 3 pairs of white socks. Another man who already bought 3 pairs of red socks and 3 pairs of white socks came back to return his 3 pairs of red socks and 3 pairs of white socks. They are both blind. As they were walking they bumped into each other. All the socks scattered around the floor, but each pair remained held together by a rubber band. Nobody helped them pick it up except each other, but in 3 minutes they both put them back altogether. Each man ended up with the same colors of socks he started with: six red and six white. How is that possible if they are blind?\nHow do cells divide?\nKangaroo-Rat from Australia as our model organiosm, since it has only 12 to 13 chromosomes.\nInsects (like the Drosophilia) divide for 13 generations in a single ‚ÄúPangea cell‚Äù. Hence, the division is extremenly synchronised.\nQuestions The constraint of space. Can‚Äôt we have a bigger nucleus? So that more space allows for less crowding bias.\nHow much force does the spindles apply when they are pulling apart the chromatins?\nHow do they [the spindles] know when its the right time to pull ?\nHow do Chromosomes find their way?\nSeveral models have been proposed. Mathematically, it was found that a random microtuble search of the space would not be enough.\nThe number of mechanisms that promote effcient chromosome capture are about 6-7 in number and still increasding.\nAnswers The correct position to grab the chromosome is done using mechanosensing. A tension-sensitive error correction mechanism is used.\nMerotelic attachment is a problematic case and is responsible for most errors during copying.\nMetaphase $\\rightarrow$ Anaphase : Separase is activated by the APC. It is the primary regulatory mechanism.\nThe seperation mechanism relies on sensing all microtubles attachment to kinetochores.\n~700 pN force is applied by the spindle.\nCell Division in Developement Eurico Morais-de-S√° Cell Polarity: Eg: Neurons; Edourard Van Beneden and Carl Rabl.\n~75% of human diseases have analogues/homologues in Drosophila.\n‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt eat much, reproduce like mad, and never demand an ethics committee‚Äù - whyfiles.org\nPAR-genes controls the cell polarity. The spatial clue is the Sperm centrosome.\nMaking polarized cells:\nflowchart TD Spatial-Cue--Symmetry-breaking--\u003e2(Distribution of Polarity determinants) 2 --\u003e X Cell Polarity is observed in multiple cell contexts.\nWhy do we care about epithelial organisation? Epithelial barriers are essential for organism compartmentalization.\n‚ÄúApical-basal‚Äù: ‚Äúinside and outside‚Äù maybe\nEpithelial cell devision in the basal part is spatially oriented. We see Planar spindle orientation that precedes planar cell division.\nEpithelial cell division:\nAsymmetric division: Different fates/ Tissue thickening Symmetric division: Identical fates/Tissue spreading The Position of the centrosomes determine the positioning of the spindle orientation.\nHertwig ‚Äúlong-axis‚Äù rule states that cells prefer to divide perpendicular to the long axis of the mitotic spindle.\nPolarity oscillations maintains tissue architecture.\nDay 2 Tublin Cytoskeleton/ Centrosomes (general principles) M√≥nica Bettencourt Dias All functions of the cell kind of depend on the cytoskeleton.\nTublins: are the functional building blocks.\nFilament polarity largely determines the complex structure of cells and its polaritty.\nMicrotubles direct vesicle trafficked by acting as tracks for motor proteins. Golgi and lysosomes move towards minus ends while secretory vescicles move towards at the plus end.\nYou have motor proteins moving across this polar track:\nDyneins: Kinesins: Dybamic Instability is driven by GTP hydrolysis. GTP units like to be straight but the GDP units like to be curved.\nCellular factors regulate Dynamc Instability: Cyclines and Cdks also change the structure of the cytoskeleton dynamics.\nAggregation follows bulk polymerization dynamics.\nThe cell controls where polymers from using nucleating factors.\nCentrosomes contains $\\gamma$-tublin which acts as nucleating sites for Tublin filamentation.\nHenneguy-Lenhossek hypothesis: Centrosomes can form spindles as well as flagella. They also form cilia.\nMost human cells have cellia, hence, problems with cillia results in a myriad of seemingly unconnected pathologies. Like Retinal degeneration, Kidney Cysts, Cognitive defects.\nCillia Assembly: The centrosomes goes to the membrane and starts assembling a microtuble structure called the Cillium.\nCentrioles are not necessary for cell division. Cell divisions can happen without it. Many organism families have dropped it altogether.\nA centrosome has two centrioles.\nChromosomes can also nucleate microtubles, hence, centrosoles are redundant for cell division.\nHuman/Mice Cells need Centrioles for cell division.\nKinesisns can also bind together to focus microtuble spindles.\nMore than one centrosome can cause a variety of cancers because they can interfere during cell division and cause aneuploidy.\nCells adapt to multiple centrosomes by clustering them, especially cancer cells.\nSenior IGC Fellow: Pedro\nBacteria have something similar to Actin and Tubilin.\nCancer Centrosomes \u0026 Cancer Mitosis\nAsymetric cell division\nAneuploidy\nIncreased/Decreased signalling plateform\nIncreased Microtuble directed polarization\nAltered Rho GTPhase activity andd Altered Focal adhesion turnover\nDay 3 Membrane Protein Proteostasis Colin Adrian 30% of proteins encoded are pushed into the Endoplasmic Reticulum, and are membrane or secretary proteins.\nWe have organelles to sepertate many different chemical processes : to compartmentalize them.\nFluid Mosaic Model:1972 to present\nTransmembrane domains are alpha helices that can be used to classify memebrane proteins\nPolytopic membrane: TODO\nCharged residues are used to emable polymerization or dimerisation.\n~50% of membrane is composed of transmembrane proteins.\nMembrane proteins are often difficult to fold. And a few disease causing mutations can cause a variety of debilitating diseases.\nThe ER is responsible for the quality control of proteins. Folding is tighly linked to the oscialltions of proteins. Addition of sugars.\nRamanujan S. Hegde for Membrane Protein studies.\nThe signal sequence hypothesis: As the polypeptide emerges from the ribosome, it is sensed and inserted in the membrane as it folds.\nSignal peptide or transmembrane domains are needed to recognize a transmembrane protein. Tail Anchored (TA) proteins have a very short C terminal and no signallling domain, hence co-translation is not possible.\nPost-translation; TODO\nLipid Droplets: Intracellular stores of triglycerides \u0026 cholestryl esters Organalles: They have their own specialised proteiome. Features \u0026 contents of liquid droplets: Phospholipid Monolayer and TAGs and Sterol ethers in the inside. Their function is to store energy in the form of Tri-glycerides. viral assembly plateforms inflammatory lipid biosynthesis TODO ERAD: ER-associated degradation for misfolded proteins. New Paradigms in Viruses Maria Jo√£o Amorim Viruses infects every organism. For example, Hepatitis B is prevelent among a lot of organismic families.\nMost epidemics and pandemics have been caused by viruses.\nIts very diffiult to have animal models where you can study viruses generally.\nIf they don‚Äôt find a receptor, they are innocuous.\nHost spillover events: virus finds a new host while jumping from its current ‚Äúnatural‚Äù host.\nViruses modify the Cell architecture/pathways/homeostasis.\nViral lifecycle:\nflowchart LR 1(x) --\u003e 2(x) 2 --\u003e 3(x) 3 --\u003e 4(x) Influenza A virion: a small virus: ~13kB\nCorrect grouping of the RNA segments is necessary for viral replication. For example in Influenza A, there are 8 RNA segments.\nViral inclusion: It is the seperation of viral components in the cytoplasm mediated by liquid-liquid phase seperation or !percolating! loose RNA-RNA interactions.\nIAV inclusions have the properties of liquid:\nFusion and division Internal rearrangement Fast diffusion Dissolve quickly (responds to stimuli) Day 4 Liquid-Liquid Phase Seperation in Biology Alex Borodavka Liquid-Liquid phase seperation:\nBrangwynne et alMembraneless organelles behave like liquid droplets.\nProgress with Live Cell Imaging has been a priminent reason for the discovery in Liquid-Liquid Phase seperation.\nFirst diffraction patterns were derived from viruses because of their symetrical structures. And they are easier to crystallize viruses.\nCrystallization was used as a purification technique for viruses and protein for years.\nThere has been a lot of progress in Live Cell imaging without tags (Differential/Nomarski interference contrast microscopy - DIC; Holographic Interference Microscopy - HIM etc)\nEthanol is added during protein precepitation with salts to change the dielectric constant of the solvent.\nTypes of Interactions, for species $a, b$:\nHomotypic interaction energies: $E_{aa}, E_{bb}$ Heterotypic interactions: $E_{ab}$ For L-L pahse separation: $$ \\chi = \\frac{E_{heterotypic} - E_{homotypic}}{k_BT} ¬ª 1 $$\nValency of interactions:\nAvidity: Multiple distinct pairwise interactions among binding sites and receptors Allovalency: Multiple epitopes along the same legands. ‚ÄúFuzzy interactions‚Äù : Multiple interchangable interaction sites.\nAt concentrations above $C_{critical}$, a protein will form droplets.\nLimiting Factor for an infinite protein droplet radius:\nConncentration outsiede the droplet ($C_{out}$) Temperature fluctuations Zeta potential and the surface charge\nBiomolecular Condensate is a mix of ‚ÄòScaffolds‚Äô and their ‚ÄòClients‚Äô RNAs can also act as ‚ÄòScaffolds‚Äô.\nLigand binding might be necessary for IDFs to go from a disordered state to an ordered transition.\nSome residues are prevalent in proteins that undergo LLPS.\nCoacervates: TODO\nSimple condensates like to exclude everything within them. So they generally have no aqueous pockets/capsules inside them.\n","wordCount":"1918","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://www.cell.com/cms/attachment/614804/4948179/gr1.jpg","datePublished":"2022-10-03T09:36:53+01:00","dateModified":"2022-10-03T09:36:53+01:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Yatharth
