How did the fly become such a dominant model organism in research? Science is produced locally, but it transmits globally. Universality: an idea of the epistemic validity of Science Locality:c science is influences by its local conditions of production Globally: the circulation of scientific knowledge, materials, and practices from one location to other. Thomas Hunt Morgan, American was responsible for coming up with Drosophilia model systems. Morgan get the Nobel Prize for ‚ÄúThe Mechanisms of Mendelian Heridity‚Äù. He inbred flies in the lab in a bio-reactor to amplify rare mutations. The first mutant he discovered was controlling the eye color of the fly. He also found that mutations co-occur. So you can put mutations into discrete groups based on co-occurance. Chromosomes can cross over which results in recombination of genes. Recombination rates can be used as a measure of proximity. From this methotend to kill you, its d they were able to create a linear photo-map of the genes. This gets the PI a nobel prize. This also cements the Chromosome-gene theory for genetics. Gene is the unit of Structure, Function, Recombination, and Mutation. Morgan runs a tight ship of the Boss and the Bois. Chromosomes are proteins + DNA. Its Nucleoproteins. H.J. muller invents the Balanced Lethal Assay. He was able to show that their is a linear relationship between X-ray dosage and the amount of mutations. He got the nobel prize for this. Mammalian Genetics ‚ÄúGot a weird mouse? Kill it and ship it to Harvard!‚Äù\nThe process and hence the research is much slower.\nSeawell Wright works extensively on Gunnie pigs.\nBecause mutations in development tend to kill you, they are difficult to detect.\nMammal and maize geneticists were interested in variable phenotypes.\nThe variability of phenotypes and their mixtures can be explained by bringing time into picture. It is the temporal dependece of certain genes.\nGoldsmith and the Production of Intersexes in Lymantira disper (Gypsy Moths) Conclusions The locus of univerality in Biology is the genetic code. Nothing else is universal in any way. Organisms evolve over time in complex ways to produce very distinct organismic systems. ",

<p>The process and hence the research is much slower.</p>

<li>
<p>Seawell Wright works extensively on Gunnie pigs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because mutations in development tend to kill you, they are difficult to detect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mammal and maize geneticists were interested in variable phenotypes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The variability of phenotypes and their mixtures can be explained by bringing time into picture. It is the <strong>temporal dependece of certain genes</strong>.</p>

<li>The locus of univerality in Biology is the genetic code. Nothing else is universal in any way. Organisms evolve over time in complex ways to produce very distinct organismic systems.</li>
