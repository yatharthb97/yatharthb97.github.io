selection theory.\nIf an organism is infected, it produces antibodies.\nThe body has antibodies for even artificial synthestic novel foreign bodies when injected.\nAntigens + Antibody results in a precipitation reaction.\nElectrophorosis of Serum Globulin, Sanger Sequencing.\nUltra-centrifugation of antibody precipitation to differentiate IGG and IGM.\nCriticisms of the Pauling approach where the Globulin changes conformation and wraps around the threat fails to explain the exponential growth observed in the concentration of antibodies over time.\nSkin grafting was a hot field after war. The rejection of foreign tissue was well known. If the same person is given the same tissue a second time it rejects is faster. This indicated an immuological response.\nIf in embroyonic life, foreign cells are introduced, then the body develops no immunological response to it. This is not entirely true, as only some particular type of tissues work this way.\nSelf-on-self-discrimination: the immune system discriminates between the tissues of its own body vs foreign objects.\nThe natural selection theory of Antibody Formation by Jesse.\nGenes and Antibodies by Joshua Lederberg.\nPAMP: Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns.\nRecommendation for immunology Textbook: Janeway¬¥s Immunobiology.\nDrosophilia and Beyond: Experimental Systems in Genetics by Michael Dietrich The designation of the ‚Äúmodel organis1m‚Äù was given to a set of organisms by the Human Genome Project in 1990. How did the fly become such a dominant model organism in research? Science is produced locally, but it transmits globally. Universality: an idea of the epistemic validity of Science Locality:c science is influences by its local conditions of production Globally: the circulation of scientific knowledge, materials, and practices from one location to other. Thomas Hunt Morgan, American was responsible for coming up with Drosophilia model systems. Morgan get the Nobel Prize for ‚ÄúThe Mechanisms of Mendelian Heridity‚Äù. He inbred flies in the lab in a bio-reactor to amplify rare mutations. The first mutant he discovered was controlling the eye color of the fly. He also found that mutations co-occur. So you can put mutations into discrete groups based on co-occurance. Chromosomes can cross over which results in recombination of genes. Recombination rates can be used as a measure of proximity. From this methotend to kill you, its d they were able to create a linear photo-map of the genes. This gets the PI a nobel prize. This also cements the Chromosome-gene theory for genetics. Gene is the unit of Structure, Function, Recombination, and Mutation. Morgan runs a tight ship of the Boss and the Bois. Chromosomes are proteins + DNA. Its Nucleoproteins. H.J. muller invents the Balanced Lethal Assay. He was able to show that their is a linear relationship between X-ray dosage and the amount of mutations. He got the nobel prize for this. Mammalian Genetics ‚ÄúGot a weird mouse? Kill it and ship it to Harvard!‚Äù\nThe process and hence the research is much slower.\nSeawell Wright works extensively on Gunnie pigs.\nBecause mutations in development tend to kill you, they are difficult to detect.\nMammal and maize geneticists were interested in variable phenotypes.\nThe variability of phenotypes and their mixtures can be explained by bringing time into picture. It is the temporal dependece of certain genes.\nConclusions The locus of univerality in Biology is the genetic code. Nothing else is universal in any way. Organisms evolve over time in complex ways to produce very distinct organismic systems. Genes in Action: The history of Development and genetics by Michael Dietrich Thomas Hunt Morgan was trained as an embryologist (a developmental biologist) but didnt adress problems from this field, ever!\nWilhelm Roux develops developmental mechanics and really likes experiments. ‚ÄúThere are particles that determine the type of cell that develops.‚Äù\nWhere (and what) is the determinant of Development?\nJacques Loeb advocates the Reductionist Approach. He also thinks that Genes as Protein and Gene actions are enzyme Actions.\nRichard Goldschmidth (color blind Gypsy moth guy) was trained with the German Morphological tradition: which is highly descriptive biology.\nTemporal Regulation: how much you produce something and when you produce something are both crucial factors.\nLinking Genes and Development can be attributed to Viktor Hamburger and Walter Landauer who were German exiles.\nThe dorsal fold plays an important role during embryonic development (Spealman and Mar‚Ä¶) It acts as an organiser of the cell.\nDead cells in the dorsal fold (in the organiser) also work. Hence, it was induced that the organiser is actually a chemical signal released by the dorsal fold area.\nDevelopment is seen as a phenomena that operates around t a network of chemical inducers that are responsible for producing different kinds of tissues. ‚ÄúA cascade of inducers.‚Äù\nNon-competent cells are not ready to receive a signal. Hence, time becomes important. It is also noteworthy that early developmental biologists thought that genes were not responsible for these ‚Äúparticles‚Äù (inducers), are purely chemical in nature. The question of the first inducer is still open.\nEmbronic development starts with making a normal table of development for a particular system.\nHomeotic Mutant: has a full body part where it was not supposed to be.\nWaddington¬¥s Branching track Model for Aristapedia (which is a fly).\nWaddington is able to map variable pheontypes using the branch track model.\nWaddington¬¥s cannalization theory with different developmental channels. Remember the dynamical attractors in ecology paper (PNAS).\nGeorge Beadle, Ed Tatum : the birth of Biochemical Genetics. The use Neurospra (bread mould).\nThey come up with the one-gene one-enzyme model. This creates biomedical genetics. You can now say: ‚ÄúThis gene is responsible for this broken metabolic process.‚Äù\nflowchart LR Gene -.\"and\".- Nutrients --\u003e Proteins Proteins --Histogenesis --\u003e Cells Cells --Morphogenesis--\u003eOrganisms ‚ÄúNever trust a Biologist about their histories.‚Äù\nBacteria-Phage Radioactive tagging experiment that determines that DNA is being transfered a sthe genetic code.\nBetter than Darwin: The Rise of the Evolutionary Synthesis by Michael Dietrich Population Genetics: focus on population measure and its statistics. founded by J.B.S Haldane, Seawall Wright, and Fisher.\nHardy-Weinberg Principle $$ p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1 $$\n$p^2$ is the frequency of AA $2pq$ is the frequency of Aa $q^2$ is the frequency of aa, A, a are alleales. There are forces than increase variability and those that decrease variability.\nSampling can drastically change the genetic makeup of the population, for example, 1 single sperm is sampled from millions during reproduction.\nA fitness landscape that can be topologically represented superimposes an infinite hypercube of the genotype network. All the organisms navigate this changing topological landscape.\nPeak Shift Problem\nSpecies and Ring Species: different clusters of the birds look like a neighbouring cluster but clusters far away look very different. The clusters are loosely isolated geographically.\ngraph LR Geographic-Isolation--\u003eGenetic-Isolation--\u003eReproductive-Isolation--\u003eSpeciation The Great Evolutionary Constriction was the ruling out of certain ideas about Evolutionary Synthesis but no concensus was obtained.\nRead about Homozygous or heterozygous.\nThe classical/Balance Controversy: which lead to global nuclear policy.\nGenetic Variation: a wild sample is more Homozygous or Heterozygous? The Action of Selection: Is natural selection most often purifying or balancing? Radiation Eugenics Hybrid Vigour: 1 single sickle cell alleale gives resistance to malaria.\nBruce Wallace and King did experiments with D flies, where you expose low power chronic vs high power chronic radiation. The adaptive value (or number of offsprings) was 0.92, 0.95 and 1.04 respectively.\nYou can‚Äôt reproduce this experiment as only the exposure can be reproduced not the random mutations.\nRadiation exposure and population fitnes was very difficult to quantify.\nElectrophorosis: seperation of molecules based on size and charge. Lewontin and Hubby (1966) used this method to seperate the genetic matter. This allowed for a quantitative measure of the variability in species.\nThe average individual in a population was heterozygous for 8% to 15%, the avaerage being 12%.\nElectrophorosis becomes a trend. Because it was fast.\nNeutal theory: most mutations are neutral and don‚Äôt affect the organism‚Äôs fitness.\nSequence revolution: a lot of variability in the clones.\nNeutral Theory is the new Null Model. Assume neutrality unil disproven by a statistical test.\nNational Museum of Creationism in Connecticut - Sex, Drugs, and Rock and roll is the path to sin.\nHopeful Monsters: EvoDevo and the Revival of Richard Goldschmidt‚Äôs Heresies by Michael Dietrich Richard Goldschmidt, German, was part of the Kieser Wilhelm Institute which is today‚Äôs max Plank institutes. He then moves to Berkely.\nSturtevant discovered that if genes are close to each other (neighbours) they affect each other. It is called the Position Effect.\nGoldschmidt‚Äôs presents the Genetic Hierarchy which states that the genes can be grouped from single gene, to gene clusters, to whole chromosoms. The different cardinal groups can transporf and transform in an affine manner.\nIn his book, The Material Basis of Evolution (1940), he introduces the concept of Gradual vs Saltation rates of evolution. Which morphs into Microevolution and Macroevolution.\nThere are Systemaic mutations, which are Chromosal emphasis. And there are Regulatory Mutations which have a Developmental emphasis.\nHomeotic Mutant:\n‚ÄúWhat good is one hopeful monster?‚Äù : Seawall Wright tackles this problem. He proposes that the major mutations are eventually finetuned while they wait some time to be expressed.\nGoldschmidt could never get published in the journal Genetics. Because he didi little experimentation and wild theorizing.\nHis work never took off in his life but got really popular in the 1980s becuas ehis work was resurrected by Steven Jay Gould.\nGould says ‚ÄúPunctuated Equilibrium is not a theory of macro mutation. It is not a Theo‚Äù #TODO\nThe Evo-Devo scientists understand Hox genes. The real break arrives with The Ubx Revival. They try an experiment where they modify a single gene which transforms a fly into a thing with many legs.\nThe Uses of Heresy: An Introduction to Richard Goldschmidt‚Äôs The Material Basis of Evolution by Stephen Jay Gould: he produces a usable history.\nReading Notes - Assignment Visual Summary of the findings from the Abstract flowchart LR Toll-Protein* --activates--\u003e NF-KB NF-KB --expresses--\u003e Inflamatory-Cytokines NF-KB --expresses--\u003e Co-stimulatory-molecules subgraph Inflamatory-Cytokines IL-1 IL-6 IL-8 end subgraph Co-stimulatory-molecules B7.1 end Some Interesting Takeaways from the first reading ‚ÄúIt thus appears that the immune-response system mediated by Toll represents an ancient host defence mechanism‚Äù (Medzhitov et al., 1997, p. 394) ‚ÄúAlignment of the sequences of the human and Drosophila Toll proteins shows that there is homology over the entire length of the protein chains‚Äù (Medzhitov et al., 1997, p. 394) ‚ÄúThe hToll gene is expressed most strongly in spleen and PBL (Fig. 3); its expression in other tissues may be due to the presence of macrophages and dendritic cells, in which it could act as an early-warning system for infection.‚Äù (Medzhitov et al., 1997, p. 394) [in mice and human cell lines] ‚ÄúAlternatively, hToll may be widely expressed because hToll signals through the conserved NF-kB pathway (see below) and NFkB is a ubiquitous transcription factor.‚Äù (Medzhitov et al., 1997, p. 394) A homologous immune response system based on the Toll signalling domain is used in plants, insects and vertebrates. In mammals, Toll induces signals required for the activation of both an innate and an adaptive immune response.
